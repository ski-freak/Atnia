List of things sources can be strong/weak in
- Units
	- Unit stats overall
	- Defensive stats & abilities
	- Aggressive stats & abilities
	- Going wide
	- Going tall
- Buffs & Protection
	- Stats / keywords & counterspells
	- Offensive / Defensive
- Early Game / Late Game
- Interaction (with:)
	- Single target removal / board clears
	- Speed of interaction
	- Reality / Dream
	- Units / Items / Spells
	- Specific context dependent interaction & weaknesses
	- Big things / Small things
	- Interaction that is Expensive / Cheap
- Card advantage / pure quantity of draw
- Card types (Units / Spells / Items)
- 


Narrower things:
- Healing (Arca)
- Temporary Removal (Eminus)
- Fight effects (Eminus)
- Pre committed interaction in the form of items (Old World)
- Extra combats (Eminus)
- Direct damage (Arca & Zelor)

Things we already decided on:
- Arca & Eminus are the primary dream interacting sources, Material, Old World and Zelor focus more on Reality. These are not hard rules but more about the efficiency / focus.
- Arca gets making things lose abilities (could move to old world that might make more sense)

Some notes:
- if we give arca the damaging stack interaction maybe we give another source the cancels (which can't go to eminus)? Maybe cancels can be old world's only/primary fast interaction?
