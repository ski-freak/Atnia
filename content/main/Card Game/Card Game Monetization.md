Yearly subscription/dlc to have all the cards (Maybe 15-20$/year roughly?). When you buy it you also get everything from the past (so if you have paid for the current year or whatever time frame, you would have all cards in the game). There would be some ability to play without paying, but it would be kind of demo adjacent.

All cards / gameplay would be available from this, you would not have to buy packs in order to get cards to play the game. There would be packs / paid dings you can buy that are cosmetics only, to help fund the game and give something for people with a bunch of money to spend on. Cosmetics would be tradable similar to cs go (you put it up for an in game currency amount). All transactions between players would effectively be taxed by some amount or be mediated through an in game currency players would be purchasing.

Card cosmetics would come in the form of styles for a given card, so if you have a style (or multiple different ones) for a card you can choose to enable it for that card in your collection/deck. (You would only ever get or need one of a given style for a given card, even if you use three of that card in your deck for example.)

You could also get cosmetics that are multiple cosmetics as a higher rarity thing, such as both full art and parallax for example.

Potential card cosmetics:
- Parallax versions
- Full Art versions
- Alternate art for named characters / things
- Card "frame" styles if we have some equivalent to that depending on how the visuals of cards are made

Other potential cosmetics:
- Alternate boards
