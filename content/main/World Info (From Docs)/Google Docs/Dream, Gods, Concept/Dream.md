Dream is concept 

We are receivers that complete a concept circuit.

Interacting with other concept circuits, do this through dream and the waking world.

What are the core areas in the dream world?

What things does every mortal entity have to interact with?

Death
All concepts of death come from dirt.
(plants are the original exception?)

Concept of reflections 

continuity

Spirits

So originally ideas are born of dream before being sent out into the universe. Ideas such as light, sound, gravity and time are transmitted onto an unfeeling, unthinking world.


For a long time swirling through the primordial mists we could only perceive others. We had no conscious concept of self, only the ability to perceive the world around us. Why would we focus on our finite selves rather than the infinite universe? And so we went about our lives like clockwork; obediently playing our parts while watching the greater machine of the universe ticked by away all around us. We were capable of true appreciation then. However one day we found a strange object: a mirror. In it was our reflection. We saw ourselves for the first time, that we were another cog in the machine, not simply an objective viewer. We discovered that we were limited, yet had more agency than we had imagined. With agency came power, but we were never able to appreciate the world around us in the same way. We could no longer simply see another's soul by looking into their eyes. Whenever we looked there all we saw was a reflection of ourselves in the shape of another person; a reflection.



Realms:
The Dream
The void
The Material

Void magic is very common among dream entities, it is the only way that they can reach the material plane after all. The material realm is a mix of dream and void; an in between point  where the two concepts meld with each other. This is where life is born. The void is very easily controlled and contained in the dream and vice versa whereas they can both become detrimental and spread in the material plane. The dream regularly employs swaths of void for “pruning” purposes as well as travel in its own realm. Dream and void have always been in conflict. They are opposing forces, neither able to get a foothold over the other, until a tentacle was ripped off of the octopus in battle. For the first time there seemed to be a definitive win to one of their battles. In reality the octopus had planned this. (some species of octopus detach a tentacle for insemination) It realized that ideas, although immortal, were also limited and that some day the dream and void would succumb to each other. So the Octopus decided to sacrifice a part of itself to breed with the void, creating mortal life. By tying itself to the very concept of void, the dream has made sure that at least some part of it will live on and not be consumed. In ancient times when mortal life had only just begun, I bet that ideas still walked amongst the material plane as gods. Eventually however the void had enough of this and formed an embargo around the material plane, meaning that dreams had to send themselves through the void and so be relatively at its mercy, or find an anchor in the material plane, (Usually a consciousness or multiple). After the embargo and dreams become scarce in the material plane, the void begins calling to mortals, telling them of endings, true endings; not being recycled. It told them of entropy and the heat death of the universe. It told them of how cold and empty and vast space was. It told them how far away all those stars really were. It told them how their own sun was a star among many which would someday die and go dark. It asked them who they were before they were born, and who they would become after.

Dreams must have an anchor in the physical world to accomplish much there, and visa versa. Nothing from the material plane is able to reach the dream world directly and so there must be a machine there to calculate the fluctuations in void and translate it into data. Matter will naturally form around information in the dream word. Getting from the dream world to the material plane is very different. If you are a being of pure dream, you will be able to cross the void in a manner of speaking, but you will be hollowed out and turned into a Shade in the process. You will be invisible and have no physical form, only able to alter people's perceptions of things, but nothing itself. Or at least that’s how it started. The material world is “neutral ground” in the cosmic battle. Dreams are only allowed to live in our world as a half form, and so is limited in its ability to gain purchase here. But Mortals minds are half made of dreams and can feed, or feed off of these entities. Many of the dream Shades that first came to our world did so out of necessity, fleeing predators in their own realm. Some people hunted and ate them. Others nurtured and protected theirs, but some very particularly clever and resourceful dreams learned to hunt mortal minds. Some of our gods were brought into this world with nurturing, protective hands, others had to claw their way into it

- The Forest of Sleeping Memory
Where everything gives you a sense of nostalgia. An infinite forest with a tree for each person who ever lived, a living embodiment of their memory. Some trees last, others don't just as some are remembered and others pass unnoticed.  The wood from the trees burns with character whatever it is turned into, and if it is treated in the proper ritual, can play back the memories of its person.
- The City of Waking Memory
- Dumping grounds for major emotions
- Various ‘afterlifes’
I haven't thought through all of the afterlife schemes, but a lot of them are just recycling plants and making up the soil of the dream realm. This is true of most of the mortal projections onto the dream world. It should work very much like a forest floor. There should be towering trees living off of the soil that provide food and homes for the denizens of the dream realm. They drop down forest litter which gets digested and transformed by insects and microbes.
- The Birthplace of Ideas
This is where most dream entities are born, at least the ones born through mortals on the material plane. It is a field of endless statues, vaguely human/egg shaped. They are covered in moss, vines and tree roots. Every once in a while one will come alight and the stone will crack revealing the entity within. This is where dreams and gods and concepts are born. They wander confused and ever searching for meaning to their existence. To a young naive dream trapped in their own world by an ocean of void, us mortals would seem like our own sorts of gods. Also maybe the statues haven't always been there, but have been built and placed there by skilled dream artisans since time immemorial. The artisans are one of the few mortal beings in the dream world. They tie themselves to their creation spending a lifetime on it. Although each looks the same from the outside, their insides are vast and unknowable. The artisans die centuries before their works ever hatch, some even die before they’re finished and have to have others continue their work for them, or veal up their half baked idea as is. An artisan never really knows what they are making, they just build the foundations. Their arts purpose is close to that of a totem or idol, only in reverse. It's the creation of a dream, made to trap a piece of reality within it rather than a being of reality attempting to capture the essence of a dream.

Concepts of fire and ice:

Fire is a piece of the void unwillingly given life. It wants to live, it wants to grow, it wants to feed, it doesn’t want to go back to the void, but it wants to consume everything if given the chance. Fires are born through breath, they are a part of you, and only sustained by you. It is life in its essence, it consumes, it lives, it dies. Yet staring through it we are able to see a portal into the void. Gods would see mortals a lot like fire. Beautiful and destructive, but ultimately unsustainable and passing. The fire only exists with the breath the gods gave us, yet it could consume their entire kingdom unchecked. 

Ice and winter is life's response to the void. In summer and spring everything is hot and wet and growing and the void gets agitated and tries to eat the world, so it goes quiet and dormant and waits for the void to relax and pass. Winter is a preserving protective force against inevitable destruction. Don’t fight with winter, don’t fight the frost dragon because it isn’t fighting you. 

Fire and Ice as focus points to disconnect yourself from your ego and connect with your sense oneness with the world. Your ego disconnects yourself from the rest of the universe, some magic revolves around remembering that you're a part of the whole. Full metal all is one, and one is all stuff.

A society starts in the heart of the north the heart of the void learning from ice lizards and making a castle

Great warriors going north to fight the void so that they will be frozen in  the permafrost (if they’re not obliterated from this universe) Immortalizing their place in the fight for life against inevitable destruction


The void is the inevitable face of the end. It is constantly happening in the north asking if it is time yet. The void will offer great riches to anyone who will commit themselves to it for it has infinite riches to spare as it consumes. It will only give them away though if it knows that they will come back and bring more with them. So great evil winter kings were made immortal, the void knowing that they will not live forever, but die in a battle that will bring more to its doorstep. This is how ghosts and wraiths are made. They are beings that the void is digesting, but slow enough that it hopes they will drag more down with them. Is this ultimately how the modern version of cities and nation states are invented? Is there a little bubble of void at the center of every major city and country? These ice kings originally started in the north, and then migrated their interests south while the heart remained in the North. The winter dragon is circling the earth either running from, or running in front of the void, protecting the living dream.

So the original denizens of the north tried to put a foothold at the center at the nexus of the voids power in the material plane. They use an ice lizard to make a big ice city. Making a foothold in the heart of the voids land is impossible and so they ultimately end up building the void its own fortress. The void realizes that it can temporarily spare people to drag more of them down to its depths. This practice spreads all over the world but starts in the north where the undead citadel is constantly trying to kill the winter Dragon. The northerners spend their time and warriors trying to defeat the citadel of undead, sometimes succeeding and sometimes adding to it. Creates this non fear of death culture that manifests in positive confrontation ways as well as negative neglect ways. People start profiteering off of this war realizing that they don’t have to make a deal with the voids themselves and become indebted to become rich, they can just manage the voids deals for it without participating. Before the infinite winter there could have been infinite great societies. We would never know, as the earth was only able to save a few pieces, The rest was devoured.

The Veriglas would be really popular in the north because they ultimately put all of their gods aside and on the same level in the face of the void, they have to.
