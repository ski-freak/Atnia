 Atnia is in the center of the great continent, surrounded by a variety of natural defenses, with only a couple of passes into the landmass be that mountain passes, the bridge across the gorge, or a port in the southeast where the gorge feeds into the sea. The great gorge extends from the coast near Hellas past Atnia and into the north. To the west of the gorge stretching all the way to the west ocean is the old world cultural group, the cultures that were directly impacted by the great ogre empire thousands of years ago.

To the south and still west of the gorge is a great desert. Unclear if this was always a desert or this is part of the impact of the ogre empire. Various cultures exist here but like the old world cultures they share some similar features on the basis of their relation to the ogre empire and the migrations that occurred after its collapse. These cultures are eventually united under the kingdom of Jespark, and expanded under Lutekai, though I don’t think he ever finishes conquering the whole territory that is sort of seen as Jespark’s “manifest destiny”.

To the north of Jespark and west of Atnia bordering the coast is Mnem, which is for the most part in the old world cultural group, though the ruling city of Mnem itself has its own unique culture based on being a port city and isolated from a lot of the rest of the old world for much of its history, receiving more contact from traders from the old world isles and Hellas.

The Old World isles off the coast of Mnem during the time of the archmages are variously occupied by forces from Mnem and Hellas in a sort of cold war situation that they are sometimes fucked by, and sometimes profit off of. 

Natives of the old world iles and hellas are descended from some of the original trading bands that would travel along the rivers across the great continent exchanging goods as they went, and partly fueled the prosperity of the ogre’s empire and allowed it to be as successful as it was.

The old world isles are sometimes also called the endless isles, and there are tales of explorers finding ever stranger people further and further north. These are never fully mapped even in the archmage’s time, and I think maybe only some indigenous goblins and orcs are aware that the old world isles and the eastern isles are actually part of the same archipelago. 

The bridge between these two sets of islands extends through the arctic, and it’s rare for even goblins to traverse it, so the people of the eastern isles and the old world isles are even more disconnected than between hellas and the old world isles. The east isles and the far east are part of further interconnected culture groups that are much less related to the old ogre empire, which never really extended past the gorge. Unsure exactly what these cultures are.

Lekvia is a mix of eastern and old world culture, settled by old world nobles but having existed around eastern culture and with eastern peasants for centuries by the time of the archmages. Lekvia was originally much smaller (around the size Atnia is now) but has expanded significantly into the east under Sorvald. 

The north is also largely populated by peoples less effected by the ogre empire and environmental collapse, and the ogres there are very different from old world ogres, viewing them as prideful and not placing themselves above the other species.

The small bubble of pilgrims exists to the north of Atnia, religious exiles from Hellas sent away for their unitarian church that really tried to dominate and stamp out the individuality of hellan religion. Their territory expands greatly under their archmage (name pending), and they make a lot of the north reliant on them.

Atnia needs to be bordered by Jespark to the south, pilgrim land (name pending) in the north, Mnem in the west, Lekvia across the gorge in the east, and Hellas near their one port in the southeast. 

There should be a continental river network that would serve as a base for a trade route leading from the old world isles near Mnem through the continent, passing through Atnia, and letting out in the river in the gorge and ultimately leading to the hellas isles. Maybe not a single contiguous river, perhaps boats are carried over land somewhere or there’s an interesting canal type space, use your imagination.
