The First Age / The Age of The First Gods / The Paradise of Hwain / The Age of First Breath / The First Sunrise / The Age of The Deep Sea / The First Winter

Approx Length: Millions to billions of years

Little is said of this age outside of myth, but most cultures around the world have legends of an era before a habitable earth. A time of great forces that would come to shape the world to be, towering titans that would create great pockets of life and send them crashing back down into the abyss or the waves.

Often these early stories speak of the first gods of the world, and are often tied in with the origins of various culture’s pantheons. Mortals rarely have any part in these stories, with the early gods often rising from the sea or the dirt and creating other gods. Mortals spoken about in myths of this time are usually larger than life and almost akin to the gods themselves.

The Veriglas is somewhat unique among tales of this time saying that first there was Hwain, god of magic, who in this era crafted the other gods. While most cultures depict this time as chaotic and destructive, to The Veriglas this era was the first paradise under the perfect order imagined by Hwain. 

The Second Age / The Age of Ancients / The Age of Dragons / The First Spring

Approx Length: Hundreds of thousands to millions of years

Still spoken of mostly in myth, stories now begin to include mortals alongside gods. Pantheons often speak of the children of the first gods during this time. Dragons and titans still dominate much of the earth and mortals live in fear of great forces beyond their control. Towards the end of the second age though mortals begin acquiring more agency over their world.

It is late in the age of ancients that The Goblins place their myth of the giving and stealing of hands. The Veriglas speaks of this era as the early strife within the pantheon of the gods, as Hwain’s children begin to undermine his rightful leadership. There are many tales of dragons in this time, which are plentiful and often slay mortals, but also often speak to them in this time. The era is commonly understood to end with the beginning of the Age of the Aulva, which the ogres understand to be their consumption of the forest dragon.

The Third Age / The Age of The Aulva / The Paradise of the Elves / The Age of the Ogres / The First Summer

Approx Length: A hundred thousand years


The Aulva (which roughly translates to “The Ogres of the Shade”) take charge of the environment in the middle of the great continent. This is often remembered as the age of the elves, with the Veriglas casting the first elves as demigods sent down by the god Hwain himself to reshape the earth in the perfect image of the heavens. Initially, the Aulva stayed in the same small region around Aton, tending to the land that was once tended to by the dragon they killed. Over time, others saw their prosperity and came seeking aid. The Aulva eventually began teaching others their methods of living and how to tap into the power of the dragons, how to manage various forms of life so that land would prosper, and how to build great cities (though they themselves mostly lived out in open nature, using enclosures to help protect creatures such as humans or goblins as well as children or valuable good stores). 

The Aulva were not always listened to in full, and other species lacked the vision of history and the future that ogres had. Many dragons are killed throughout this era and not everyone is an equally good custodian of the land, many prioritizing short term gains without realizing the long term damage they were causing. Since all of this land is interconnected even the area around Aton which is well cared for begins to suffer and wither. The Aulva retreat into their glade and guard it allowing none to enter while they deliberate on what to do, marking the end of the age of the Aulva.

Notably the Aulva were not all ogres by the end of this era. While the name means “Ogres of the Shade”, many others, particularly goblins, are eventually welcomed into their core tribe as equals.

The Fourth Age / The Age of Kings / The Age of Nobility / The First Fall

Approx Length: Ten thousand years



With the Aulva retreating to their caves the others are left to their own devices with the tools of empire that were handed to them. Humans in particular quickly turn this technology to rulership and war. For much of this time the continent is dominated by two great human empires Cornagt and Xwageen, though these empires have yet to take the form they will in the future where they oppress orcs and goblins, instead mostly focusing on internal struggles and battles with one another. They also don’t even cover most of the landmass most likely but have the widest spread ruins from this era and get mythologized as rulers of the whole world later. Orcs and goblins dominate the seas and rivers during this time and their trade remains as vital as it was during the prior age. As millennia pass the Aulva are rarely encountered by anyone in person and the popular image of them begins to drift. Though plenty of other ogres exist in the world, people begin to forget that the Aulva were ogres at all as their appearances change and are exaggerated.

The Veriglas paints these two great human empires as initially one (which may be true), ordained as the rightful rulers of a new human world by the Aulva and thus directly by the gods (likely untrue, more probably what happened is that there was a human the Aulva agreed to talk to when they were talking to almost no one, and they took this as ordained kingship). But the division of this empire into two was the beginning of splintering from right rulership that would eventually lead to the gods’ wrath.

One popular semi-mythological story from this time casts Cornagt (which covered much of the north of the great continent) as the righteous lineage of the world and Xwageen (which rested in what is now Jespark) as separatist traitors. So much time has passed that few know who they can trace their lineage to from this time, but it is common to insinuate in human societies that villains descended from Xwageen or The Horned Legion (coming up in the next age).

Towards the end of The Fourth Age crops begin to fail as the earth turns to ash. The two kingdoms war with each other in greater frequency as resources fail, and the people begin to riot and rebel after years of starvation and warfare. Also lacking food, the river traders that once brought trade and supplies become just as likely to raid the shores.

For their part, the Aulva spent this time coming to truly understand the lesson their dragon tried to teach them all those years ago – for life their must be death, and life cannot be allowed to cling to its own existence for longer than its time, or calamity would come. They provide guidance and help to those that seek their aid when they can, but close their doors to most, for they see it as their duty to not intervene in the coming age of calamity and allow the deaths of those who fall to it to fertilize the soil once more. 

The Fifth Age / The First Age of Calamity / The Second Winter

Approx Length: Five Thousand Years

The Age of Calamity is said to begin with the collapse of Cornagt, as the gates of the palace are stormed by a mob of starving peasants. This is often written in history as a great betrayal and a tragedy, but many peasant rebellions in the years to come take inspiration from this fall. Less is written about the fall of Xwageen but it, too, collapses in these early years. Nobles still hold claim to smaller territories within these vast empires, using force to hold the populace together and gather and distribute what little food can be produced and hold to the failing farms. In history this is often painted as a noble endeavor, but the reality is that these small fiefdoms scar the soil in a way that will take centuries to repair.

Seeing that the other mortals were not allowing nature to take its course and would cause perhaps irreparable damage to the earth clinging to the fleeting lives of their kingdoms, the Aulva gathered an army, at first just of their closest confidants. These became the first of The Horned Legion, named for the great antlers that many would attach to their helms. In mythology, The Horned Legion, led primarily by ogres, wiped out the Aulva before sweeping across the world and destroying all of their rightful lieutenants, through their wrath and jealousy bringing an end to the paradise envisioned by the elves.

The Horned Legion first met with a horrible defeat at the hands of some long forgotten petty king, having underestimated the knowledge of the ways of war that mortals had learned in their millennia of absence. Recognizing the direness of their task and the need for a greater army, they began recruiting mercenaries from roving and starving bands, convincing them that they could be fed off the backs of the hordes of food held in the palaces and guarded gates of the various kings. With this they swept across the continent and brought an end to countless minor kingdoms that had cropped up in the wake of the collapse of the great ones. With each battle more displaced people were in need of food and protection, and this The Horned Legion provided. 

When all was said and done The Aulva left again, returning to caves and deeps to nurture and heal the land from below. The legion disbanded as they left, armed with the little knowledge the ogres provided them with how to live off the land in times of lack. The descendents of The Horned Legion wrote nothing down, and for centuries were cast as barbarians by the displaced nobility, who built kingdoms where they could on the coasts and isles. For many years the heart of the mainland became uninhabitable for the civilized, who were always beset by barbarians seeking to tear down all they strove to build.

The age of calamity had little impact on the north, which was always locked in constant war with its harsh environment anyway. 

It was during the later part of this era as human nobles began to rebuild kingdoms elsewhere that the concept of the nation of Atnia was born. Remembering Aton as the heart of the elvish empire, Atnia was a hypothetical kingdom at the heart of the seat of rulership to the world, that many thought would one day be claimed. Over the years the title became a sort of double edged sword, the highest honor but at the same time an impossibility to attain. Often it was granted to popular individuals a ruler wanted out of their hair.

As civilizations crumble and growing bands of starving marauders roam the land, a few brave souls remember how in the olden days the elves took their power from the dragons, and taught others to do it as well. Some of these roving bands become dragon hunters, seeking to defeat dragons however they can, and some succeed. This includes the time of Zoggir. For a brief time the age of scarcity abates as many learn to perform great feats of magic and teach others as well. 

The Sixth Age / The Age of Magic/ The Second Spring

Approx Length: Two Thousand Years

Little is truly known about the sixth age, and stories of it are shrouded in often doubted legends of great feats of heroism and magic. It was a wild and chaotic time full of possibilities, where the veil between dream and reality was thin. 

The Veriglas characterizes this old magic as witchcraft and heresy, claiming it was smote down by the very gods themselves. Part of the truth is that the Aulva saw this burgeoning magic as a threat to the healing of the environment, and planted seeds of fear in the ears of those too ready to listen, and subtly encouraged the persecution of mages.

It is also during this era that a certain goblin nearly conquered the entire world, then vanished from the face of the earth. 

The Seventh Age / The Age of Mortals/ The Second Summer

Approx Length: One Thousand Years

Following the sixth age, magic becomes a rarity once more and all but disappears from open practice. Some do practice, of course, but it is passed down in secret for bands of human mage hunting knights now roam wherever they can reach. This era is the first age that is truly dominated by humans and human xenophobia. While their great empires did threaten to harm the earth itself, they were never truly more powerful than the roving traders or “barbarians”. But now with magic as something scarce the industry and brutality of human nobility has a true time to shine, and while there is always a sense that the new kingdoms are lesser than what came before, in truth they are more durable in their brutality than ever. 



It is during this time that the first of the great nations that would become cemented under the archmages begins to form. Mnem was actually founded during the age of calamity, by a band of nobles that fled The Horned Legion all the way to the coast. They were spared because they survived off trade with the isles to The West, no longer destroying the land beneath their feet. While this kingdom never grew large, it prospered and held great influence as one of the oldest kingdoms in the world that could trace its lineage back to the nobles of Cornagt. 

Jespark in theory is the direct continuation of the old empire of Xwageen, but unlike in Mnem there are very few written records and this is often hotly disputed. While technically by far the largest empire in this era it doesn’t actually control the vast majority of its land for most of this time, with many indigenous peoples living within its borders totally unaware that they are supposed to be part of a great empire.

The Hellas isles are heavily settled by human nobles fleeing after the calamity, who intermingle with the indigenous populations, largely of orcs and goblins who had been using those isles as a base for their trade routes for millennia already. These isles coalesce into a loose cultural group, with most islands operating independently and governing themselves in a variety of ways. Wars and raids are frequent and the isles rarely agree to do anything together, but begin to recognize themselves all as one people in a loose sense when compared to the rest of the world.

Lekvia at this time is a complete footnote in history but noted here for its relevance later. Originally settled by Jespark nobles who were granted an “oh, fuck off over there” title, it eventually splits off and develops an independent cultural identity. 

It is during this era that The Veriglas is founded, which is initially considered just a strange cult and is persecuted almost everywhere it goes. The Veriglas argues for a unification between the gods of all peoples, the splintering and holding of personal gods above others is what leads to war and strife, and that all of these stories told around the world are based around a central truth that the elves once knew. And that when all come to accept the true gods of the world again the paradise of the elves will be returned. The Veriglas are eventually exiled into the north under the assumption that they will die out, but they do not, eventually converting many of the northern tribes. 

The Eighth Age / The Age of The Archmages / The Age of the Aulvalin / The Second Fall

Approx Length: Two Hundred Years

The Veriglas funds an archaeological expedition into Aton where the fated band of scholars would partake of the ancient dragon and gain power beyond their wildest dreams. Sorvald would return to his nation of Lekvia where he would become high physician and rule from the shadows. Cyrvo would mend a schism within The Veriglas and become its high pontiff. Pyrus would aid the struggling keep of nobles holding on to the title of rulers of Atnia in building it into a true nation, exiling the barbarous ogres who kept foiling their attempts to hold it in the process. Oana would become ruler of Mnem. Augusta would gather an army of mercenaries set on protecting the isles from pirates, and wind up with a great fleet that upheld a peaceful Hellas. Nyka would retreat into dream, gaining followers who saw wisdom in the warnings she would whisper in the night. Eventually Lutekai, a noble from Jespark, would train under Sorvold and develop a new style of magic, eventually venturing into Atnia to partake of the dragon himself.

Oana understood from the beginning that becoming archmages was beginning a war with the ogres. It was she who pushed for their persecution in the other nations, who played into their existing reputation as demons, and who sought to combat them directly. This was a war that she lost, for in persecuting the ogres she kept them at the heart of her empire and was overrun. The ogres had been unprepared for brutality like they were shown and were on the back foot for the early age of the archmages, but after breaking through and taking Mnem from Oana they set their sites on reclaiming control of the dungeon at Aton to undo the damage of the archmages and begin replanting the dragon once more. 

The Ninth Age / The Second Calamity / The Third Winter

Approx Length: 5-100 years

In an instant the whole world unraveled. To the Ogres of Mnem this was a battle many years in the making, and the apocalypse others see is merely the continuation of the age of the archmages and the battle for the future of the world. To The Forsaken, The Second Calamity was only the immediate destruction and apocalypse, and we have been living in an age of true freedom for mortals ever since, with the gods cast out and the ability to forge our own future.
