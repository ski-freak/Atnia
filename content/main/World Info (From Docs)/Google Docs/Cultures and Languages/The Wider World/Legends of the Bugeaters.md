Goblins have a complex relationship with insects. On the one hand, they treat them as any of the other sapient species. On the other, Goblins are lizards and naturally consume insects. Different groups of goblins have different cultural norms around the consumption of bugs. Some never eat insects, others do occasionally, and others actively farm them. There is a common belief that there is power in consuming insects, and some groups of goblins have rituals around eating certain bugs before battle. 

Most goblin cultures have legends of Bugeaters – evil goblins who deviate from their norms of insect consumption. This has often been a cause for war between groups of goblins. It’s not uncommon for two groups of goblins to characterize one another as Bugeaters. Underlying these disagreements, however, is a very serious fear.

Legends tell of goblins who consume entire hives of insects whole before committing terrible atrocities, seemingly empowered by some kind of dark energy. Many goblin tribes even have stories of their own members falling into bug eating and becoming toxic and destructive to those around them. The most famous and worst of these legends is the tale of the Bug Hunt.

Stizit of the Heirne is among the most infamous goblins in history (among other goblins, anyway). Driven from his home (the city of Ethleka) as a Bugeater, Stizit became a bandit along the Heirne river, recruiting other goblins to his side. As he traveled he carefully documented and collected knowledge on all types of insects, and in particular on how to trap and kill them, or drive them from a land. This knowledge was collected in twenty six grimoires, even one of which is said by goblins to be enough to cause terrible destruction. After years of banditry Stizit gathered his forces to take revenge on his home, but rather than attacking their armies directly he conducted the most effective Bug Hunt in recorded history. Stizit’s band captured and feasted on every insect they could find for several years, evading enemy forces and keeping up a steady supply of their own food. While Stizit was eventually captured and executed by the superior force that chased him, it was not long until the once great city of Ethl
eka became completely uninhabited, and its ruins now reside in a small wasteland that has still not grown back or returned to life.

The original twenty six grimoires have been scattered, and many are thought to be destroyed, but others have been recreated since. During the time of the human archmages, many goblins who suffered the worst persecution turned to bug eating, and whispers spread that now, if ever there was one, the time for a Bug Hunt.
