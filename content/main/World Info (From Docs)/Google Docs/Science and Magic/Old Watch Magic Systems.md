Old Watch Magic Systems:

All magic must have a source and most must have a direction. The source can be fairly abstract and utilizing the source does not necessarily deplete it.

Hard and soft magic should both be options for players. I’m going to focus on the hard cut rule side since the other is much simpler. 


Types of Magic:
Sacrificial Magic
This type needs a source whether it’s yourself, your enemy, fresh soil, or a cake. It is technically always finite, but given a good connection and the right source the power could be effectively unlimited for you.
Inherent Magic
This type is often less powerful but much more reliable. One can draw power and knowledge from the soil without draining it, or from the darkness without having to bring the dark. This magic comes and goes without effort but is also beyond the users control and often accidental. (Think feats in 5e and shit that people forget to use half the time)
Single use Magic
Like certain ancient charged artifacts or the Inkbloods with their tattoos or the pale sun with their unending consumption of all. This bleeds into sacrificial magic however, like when an inkbloods ink finally turns into ink. 




Trading or Given Magic
There are things inherent to people that cannot be used unless freely given or traded like an organ or an emotion or a soul. Very similar to sacrificial magic, accept for the fact that sacrifice can take place without consent.
Social or Group based Magic
Magic which relies on, or is influenced by a larger group. 
Locational Magic
Magic tied with a specific location. One doesn’t necessarily have to be in that location to use that magic however, rather they need an anchor point like soil from the homeland (dracula), water from a lake, or a seed from a tree. When diluted with inherent magic, one can gain power from general features instead of singular ones, like all mountain ranges rather than just one.
Chronological Magic
It’s in the name. Magic that goes off at a certain time, that sort of thing. I have less thoughts about this one; whether it should exist or be absorbed into other categories. It could possibly help with the mechanical aspect of scrying/retconning since the players/DM can’t see the future and don't know how shit will pan out. Instead of giving the player advantage in the moment or something, it gives them bonuses to investigating anything tangentially related to the thing they asked about. Basically just insight into more abstract concepts in the game.
Law Magic
Similar to Social and Given magic, but reliant on more abstract principles whether they be natural or created. Consent is still involved, but it might not be your consent


Archmage Magic:
(Go into detail about how especially these were stolen from native techniques and practices)
Dream magic
Law magic
Divination magic
Bio magic
Divine magic 
History of magic
Engineering magic



Dream Magic:








When writing a spell:
Type: Types of magic
Intent: Why the magic is cast
Result: What the magic accomplishes

1) Consider how the magic is cast for the first question. If you’re casting a fireball, then how? How is it coming about? How are you manipulating it?

Are you manipulating the flammability of the air to spread a spark? 
Are you releasing the saved potential from fires set earlier or transporting that of one burning elsewhere? 
Are you bringing your fiery passion from the dream world to this one? 
Or are you just throwing an explosive? 

It’s not just flavor, it matters. Are you manipulating the fire's existence or conjuring it? The former for number one, and the latter for number three. One could argue either or both for number two. In terms of schools, one would primarily be a mix of Law, Divination, and History, but even a little dream or religion might be necessary simply for the belief in what you’re doing. The same for two. Number three would mostly be dreams or religion of course, and four would likely be medicine or truth (what I’ve decided to call Lutekias for now)

2) Then consider intent. Fire will generally be destructive, but not necessarily. If it is being summoned for destructive purposes then consider whether you would prefer to have more precision, power, or longevity in your casting? How often can you cast it? Is it tiring? How hot or large or forceful do you want the fire to be? Do you want to be able to change that, or are you fine with it being the same every time? Do you want precision control for sneaky things like igniting the powder in a bullet in the chamber of someone's gun, causing them to fire it or ignite all of the candles in a cathedral at once? Are you trying to blast through stone walls, or just keep a bonfire going for hours?

3) And then the result is up to the DM. Write your spells up and check them over with the DM before playing so that you’re not both caught on the spot, they might not okay every idea you have or may alter it.

Inherent sources:
The self: dreams, emotions etc
Repetitive action
Natural forces: sunlight, wind, tectonics etc
Comprehension  

Sacrificial sources can unfortunately be pretty much anything.

Effects:
Creation
Destruction
Manipulation

     




Ok, so law magic can have its own specialities, but in large part be a gateway to the other forms of magic. Law magic is built around language and symbols. The hexagon is the most utilized shape in law magic because law magic draws from all of the other types, just as they draw from it. The seventh form is the space in between. The negative space.

Law
Divination
Medicine 
Religion
Dream
History 
Truth

Inkblood spell Ideas:
(I have no idea, these are all shots in the dark, please make your own additions)

Tattoo spells: (Most of these are limited use unless your blood becomes ink, but not all)


Utility:

Elemental tattoo: There is a symbol for each element on you. From the fire one you can pull small embers, a minor breeze from the air one (enough to breath underwater though, and small amounts of dirt or clay from the earth symbol. A useful tattoo among survivalists. 

Temporary darkvision: Ink pools into the casters eyes and they become black. Darkness gives off its own light for a limited time, while light becomes blurry and obscured

Translate writing: Either an eye or hand tattoo. Either the caster sees an inky translation projected onto they’re sphere of vision, or they have letter glyphs on their hands which shift and move as they move past the page like a rosetta stone.

  Combat:

Thorns: distanced. Spikey tattoos form into needles like projectiles.

Thorns: Melee. Thorny spikes pop up all over the casters skin making them difficult to grapple, and giving them a slight bonus to unarmed combat.

Shadow Tentacles. Can be used to jab, pull and grapple
Hand glyphs are especially important to the inkblood caster as there is limited space for their etching and hands are a symbol of power/essential to the work. One could have one plan which burns with heat, and the other cold, one be creation, the other destruction, one be light, the other be darkness, or sound. One could have the symbol of growth etched there and be able to tend to plants or those being held back by something. A hand of the unseen could disappear, or actually move through liminal spaces whilst not being actively perceived. The options are limitless, obviously they don’t have to always be opposing forces, I just enjoy symmetry.

I guess an inkbloods spells should all be spatially related to their bodies.

Head- Tracking, translation, memory, dream and breath spells
Shoulders- wings
Chest- Most space
Back- Most space
Arms- Shields, melee, climbing
Hands- Specialties (usually)
Hips
Legs- Speed
Feet- Climbing, ballance
