Oana was born a curious child into an uncurious family. Her parents were nobles of Mnem, who could trace their lineage all the way back to the first empire. She was raised on myths of great kings and queens, their righteous rule, and how it was all taken from them by the monstrous horned legion whose blood today could be found in the ungrateful peasants who would even now that they saw the lowly state they had reduced the world to refuse to work the land for their betters.

Oana was punished for behaving out of line, and educated in the classics as befit any noble. She was too curious to not be rebellious under such an upbringing, and asked incessant questions about the horned legion. Why did they tear down the first empire if it would make them suffer too?

She was punished for asking such things, but it did not stop her. Only one adult in her life would answer her – the black sheep of the family who the others ignored. Oana’s uncle had gone to Hellas to get a proper worldly education, and come back with all sorts of strange ideas that contradicted the history the nobles of Mnem knew to be true. He was full of stories of the past, all qualified with mights and maybes. None of the certainty presented by the other nobles, and all kinds of little facts and tidbits. He also taught Oana the bits he knew of how to interpret elvish ruins, and fed her curiosity with stories of great treasures hidden beneath the earth in their ruins. And he spoke of other species, of peasants, as equals not lessers, of beings with rich and interesting lives that had simply learned different things. To him, learning was the most important thing there was, and what you learned shaped you as a person. He was also a very moral person, and seemed to hope that Oana would somehow be better than her parents. She wished to please him, perhaps more than she did her parents, but she also felt pressured by him just as she did by them. 

This produced in Oana a great many conflicts. For she liked the thought that she was descended from heroes and kings and queens. She liked the thought that she was owed riches by the world. She knew herself to be greater than those around her, and not just the peasants or those outside of Mnem. She was much much cleverer than her parents and the other nobles. These conflicts manifested in a web of contradictory values in her growing psyche:

Material wealth vs. intellectual/spiritual wealth
Pride in lineage vs. empathy and understanding for other experiences
Grievance vs. acceptance

And these concepts warred within her as she grew into a young teen. She dreamed of going on adventures and returning, proving herself to all, and the pressures placed on her by the adults around her evaporating in recognition of her brilliance. 

One day she went on this adventure, delving deep into the forest with a stolen ancestral sword in the dead of night. She found herself at an old elvish ruin, guarded by a great Ogre with a great horned helm. The ogre was amused by this clever child, and entertained her with stories. Veiled warnings she was quick to understand. He told her of the tale of Lug, and she understood that he meant if she were to delve into the ruin either in body or soul a part of her would die. She knew too of the conflict raging within her, and understood that she would have to kill one of the versions of herself and leave it behind in that ruin if she were to complete her quest. But this she could not accept. The story of Lug was far too sad.

Oana delved into the ruin, and either in the physical world or in dream battled her own shadow. She did not win and she did not lose, instead finding its name and integrating herself into a terrible whole. 

She came to understand that material wealth stemmed from intellectual might.
She could better her lineage through empathizing with others and understanding what their uses might be. Through both her mind and her blood she could be better than both alone.
She could accept the fallen world she was born into, and rather than being stuck in the past avenge the grievance of her ancestors in full acknowledgement of the present.

All she had to do was emerge from the cave a hero. 

She interpreted what secrets she could of the runes of the elves, and there she caught a glimpse of the true nature of the horned legion, and the historic conflict of which she was a part. She had been right that her parents were petty and broken, pale reflections of the noble lineage that came before them. Through understanding she could reignite the fire of the first empire and revive it within this world. 

She left the cave and slew the ogre at the door, taking its horned helm as a trophy to return a hero to Mnem. None dared admonish the young adventurer again, and it wasn’t long before she had boarded a ship to Hellas to study the ancient elves. 

Her outward persona became like that of her uncle, but inwardly she held all the pride and ambition of her family. Directed at the slow progress she made on research and negotiating for the resources for an expedition to unearth the great ruins of the elves to truly understand the lives they had lived. Though she rarely spoke it out loud out of political necessity, her hunch grew only stronger with the passing years. That the Aulva and the Horned Legion had always been one and the same. 

In adulthood Oana has a flatter character arc, her battle with herself already resolved. She simply follows the path she chose in youth to fruition. Importantly neither side won out in her battle with her other self, instead she chose to integrate them, just in a way that we would understand as grotesque.
