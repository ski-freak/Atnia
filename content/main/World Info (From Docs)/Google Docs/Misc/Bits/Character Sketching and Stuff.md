# Hero, Hunter of Nightmares:

Group Role: Dream aberration 

Appearance: Human

  

Core Belief: A dream simply is. Hero has no personal trauma or personal backstory. He came about from the sincere wish to be rescued from Nightmares. He is simplistic in his approach, fighting things head on. But he also knows that mortals are weaker than the nightmares they conjure individually. The strength unique to mortals is their ability to cooperate and work together. Time and time again before he crossed the mountains from the roiling chaos of dream he saw that the nightmares he defeated would return ever stronger unless those who dreamt them found companionship in this world. Thus he travels the waking world of Atnia seeking to spark friendship and unity among all he meets, so that the great eight armed nightmare of the depths might one day be slain.

Which is rationalized as…

Stated Belief: Inarticulate as the villagers often are, their superstitions contain a basic wisdom. We would do well to heed the warnings of our elders and devote our reason to understanding why they are right rather than tearing them down for their confused wording.
