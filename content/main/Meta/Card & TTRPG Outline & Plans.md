This will be a "short" outline of the current card game, ttrpg, and related projects. These are fairly interconnected so here is a document for the games and the plans for them going forward.

# Project Gamma (The temporary name for the card game)

Card game project started by Ski in 2023, Birds/7teenwriters has been helping with the design as well. Multiplayer card game similar to Magic the Gathering, Legend of Runeterra Hearthstone, etc, although of course in Ski's opinion, with better design. There is also a distinct focus on avoiding the monetary pitfalls of other card games as it was partially born out of frustration with them. 

Currently the game rules are mostly finished, card sets are a work in progress (we have many cards but they need more testing / balance), and there is no art / no final graphic design. The card game is using the setting from the TTRPG (more details below) which is also a work in progress. Some small scale testing has been done with temporary cards, but a big push for more testing will need to be done soon.

The long term goal is to get the game to exist as either a video game, paper game, or both. The rules and cards are being made in a way where they will work on both. We now have a few people (Kengi, Testr, and Chips) who are working on a prototype video game version for testing and iterating on the card sets.

Currently we have enough card designs to test with, the cards in the main google sheet are being named and given temporary card images (as well as having the rules text reformatted to work with the updated game rules). Once this is complete and the testing program is ready, people will be gathered to play the game, test cards and decks, and basically try to break and balance it. Along with this the game rules may need to be polished more.

That will be done with *all* of the current cards. Currently cards are basically being made as one huge pile (Ski has like 600ish now). This big pile will then be pulled from to create actual card sets as you would normally expect from a card game. It seems to simply be easier to design this way, as trying to create a set of cards with roughly equal numbers of card types, sources/colors, costs, etc, while also creating the cards at the same time is extremely difficult. It seems it is much easier to just make a bunch of cards, and pull from them while adding a few new ones to create a final card set. Cards unused in the initial set(s) will simply be pushed off to be used later.

- You can find rules for the card game here: [[Card Game Rules Doc]], and the card design spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RDuqokq3RVDQv1vOBgSlnQbRpQ1KFyX1tBaPVvDhRUk/edit#gid=1256812815)

# Atnia / Nightmares from the New World / The Old Watch (The TTRPG)

A table top rpg project (think D&D) by Birds/7teenwriters, Fionn, Aurora, and Ski is helping a little bit maybe. This consists of game rules for the ttrpg as well as the setting for it, which goes by a bunch of names right now, but the primary geographic area is called Atnia. You can find more information about it here [[Atnia One-Pager]]. This site is currently storing the work in progress documents for the game and setting.

As it shares a setting, it is fairly interconnected with the card game. Soon we will be creating a bit more of a public web presence for the it / the setting, which may include a main page, discord server for people to contribute to lore, and/or youtube channel with series that contribute to worldbuilding.

I (Ski) do not have extensive knowledge of the short/long term plans for the TTRPG project, so cannot add them at this time.
