**## Nation: Mnem

Mnem is directly to the east of Atnia, and contains significantly more “elvish” ruins. There, Oana studies the foundations of magic and its origins. The nation has a large ogre population, and is where some of the worst atrocities against ogres occurred in the old world including lobotomies “for their own good”. Right before the apocalypse there is an ogre rebellion and they take over the nation and attempt to negotiate with the archmages as equals. Their missives are ignored, and while it is likely that the archmages would go to war with them eventually if they did not destroy one another first, their primary concern is one another.

Archmage: Archmage Oana

Oana was the teacher of the other archmages on their expedition to the ruins at Aton, and a specialist in archaeology and the history of the ancient elves. Even as the archmages drift apart their ambition is kept somewhat in check by their shared respect for their old teacher. 

Domains: Magic

This is the study of the structure of magic itself. If alchemy is physics the study of magic is sort of like a ‘meta-physics’, or the study of the rules by which the world might be manipulated through magic, and the energy that is produced. Spells might include: magic missile, detect magic, or counterspells or types of magic that cause other spells to fizzle, misfire, or change. 

Associated God: Hwain 

Hwain is the ‘elvish’ god of magic, mud, and the elves themselves (at least so goes the common theory, as the writings of the elves show they thought of themselves as composed of mud). Elvish gods were made into canon godso op i immediately on the foundation of the true church, for how can these great magical beings have been wrong about such things?

## Nation: Atnia 

Atnia is the central nation the game focuses on, located right in the middle of the other archmage’s empires with no hope of expanding its borders, at first glance it seems to be the weakest of the archmage’s countries.  Despite its small territory and armies the land is highly defensible. Tightly controlled by a “perfect and just” system of magically enforced laws and contracts. 

Archmage: Chancellor Pyrus

Pyrus was one of the students brought to Aton, chosen for the expedition due to his particular expertise with languages. Originally, he intended to become an ambassador after his schooling, and his focus on language came alongside a keen understanding of law and formal logic which he used to help make sure contracts and treaties were airtight across translations. After the discovery of magic each of the other archmages went off in their own directions ultimately to found empires, but Pyrus remained at the site at Aton, seemingly lacking in the ambition of the others. In truth, Pyrus became obsessed with the idea of soft power and perfected structures, curating the region around the ruins at Aton into a perfect physical and diplomatic fortress with the idea of subtly controlling the other archmages at his whim through his own indispensability. Pyrus worked tirelessly to keep the peace between the archmages through negotiations and treaties, and in doing so exercised his unique form of influence across the world. 

  

Worth noting here that the archmages are all dictators of their nations in some capacity, but frame it in different ways. Pyrus takes on the title of chancellor positioning himself as an official of the state and adding an air of legalism and process to his rule. 

  

Pyrus was once close with Sorvald and Augusta, though in their later years even the closest friendships among the archmages became strained. 

Domains: Law, language, contracts, math, logic

Spells include binding contract magic, magical translation, detecting truth or lies or paradoxes of logic. 

Associated God: Oln

God of the underworld, but also strongly associated with law and also commerce (I think I’ll take the tradition of giving a coin to the ferryman to the land of the dead/burying people with coins).

  

## Nation: Mykeldor

Mykeldor stretches across the great mountains in the north, with holy city upon holy city dotting it’s peaks and reaching towards the heavens. A theocracy with power over the other nations through its complete control over the official true church.

Archmage: Pontiff Cyrvo

Cyrvo was not one of the original students on the expedition, but a powerful member of the church that funded it and helped organize the mercenary support. Following the success of the expedition he went to meet the scholars and check on their progress in the now rapidly expanding village around the ruins. He ultimately managed to play off both the archmages and the church to gain access to the magical secrets they had discovered and become the pope of what he quickly began professing as the world’s one true church — which he could prove by directly contacting the gods and producing divine miracles.

  

Unique among the archmages, Cyrvo held no special respect for the teacher Oana, never having been her student and secretly sneering at the secular colleges. Though the scholars initially treated him as a friend, as they rose to power as archmages he quickly became the most despised among them – though there was little the others could openly do without risking rebellions in the righteous name of his church. 

Domains: Gods

Uniquely among the other archmages Cyrvo derides magic openly as a sin. His followers are to only perform those miracles that are granted to them by the gods. In order to do so just a little bit of magic is needed in order to open the pathway for them to directly commune with the gods, make deals with them, and ask their blessings. The spell is cast only once on the up and coming priest, and from there the rest of their magic is granted to them at the whim of the god they swore an oath to.

Associated God: Ozen

King of gods and god of kings, the great and wise sun god. Zeus/Odin sort of figure. Worth noting here that when Cyrvo professes the great gods of the main pantheon to the world he does not explicitly say the gods are supposed to represent the archmages, but since all the others have clear parallels the implication is obvious. 

  

## Nation: Lekvia

Lekvia is directly to the south of Atnia across the great gorge. Similar to Atnia it is relatively unassuming in its size, but unlike Atnia a heavy emphasis is placed on its military. The nobility is full of knightly orders, and Lekvia regularly supports the other archmages in their righteous conquests. Renowned also are Lekvia’s doctors and alchemists, numerous enough that even the lowliest of peasants can anticipate living nearly a century with good habits. 

Archmage: Court Physician Sorvald

Sorvald was one of the original scholars among the expedition to Aton. Studying to be a doctor he was fascinated by the longevity of the ancient ‘elves’, and guessed that some mystical secret or medicine was at its root. The young Sorvald dreamed of curing the world of death. Upon discovering magic Sorvald pursued his dreams of immortality with renewed rigor, and discovered many of the secrets that kept the archmages alive for many centuries – Though never discovered the secret of True immortality, which he continued to seek until the very end.

  

Sorvald did not set himself up as the apparent leader of any nation, instead returning to his home city-state of Lekvia and instating himself as the court physician of the king. With the advancements in medicine and alchemy Lekvia quickly expanded to a modest empire. All the while kings and queens grew old and died but the same court physician remained. Though not in any official position of power his advice across the years became impossible to question. Similar to Pyrus, Sorvald understood the value of existing in the background. Leaving the day to day management of the kingdom to its official rulers he was left with ample time to pursue his quest for immortality. 

  

Friend of Pyrus, teacher and later rival of Lutekai. 

Domains: Transmutation, alchemy, medicine, immortality

Spells include healing magic like the ability to stitch together wounds or extract poison from the bloodstream, transforming basic substances into their component parts or combining them. Generally slower magic performed in a laboratory rather than fast flashy stuff. 

Associated God: Braeg

God of the forge, innovation, progress, society. There are some connections with longevity due to blacksmithing being considered as an old person’s art (or one that requires a lifetime to master), but this is probably the worst fit of any of the gods. Maybe an insult from Cyrvo making this one one of the main gods instead of one more directly connected with medicine and such (there’s a bit of a feud between these two, more on that later on). 

  

## Nation: Hellas

Hellas is in the southeast, south of Lekvia with a long coastline bordering the ocean and several islands as well within its domain. Hellas has the most advanced navy of any nation which is used both for military purposes and for traversing great distances to observe the stars and other celestial bodies from particular points devoid of any obstructions that one finds on land. 

Archmage: Queen Augusta

Agusta was among the original scholars and a close friend of Pyrus. As the archmages went their separate ways she feared greatly the power growing within all of them and what it might become, and her paranoia led her to keep careful tabs on her friends, developing many magical techniques for observing things indirectly through signs in the sky as well as the inherent connections between spaces and events beyond human observation.

Domains: Divination, scrying, the connections between spaces, messages

Spells include prophecies, the ability to see things across space, and the ability to send messages across great distances. 

Associated God: Tta

The elvish goddess of connection between spaces, symmetry, and prophecy (complete misinterpretation, ‘tta’ wasn’t a god at all for the ogres, just the concept that the whole might be contained within a part. Literally the idea that within a particular breath of air is the essence of all air in the world). 

  

## Nation: Oloch

The shifting land, one ought not attempt to traverse Oloch without a guide. Dream and reality blend together, and the roads and cities are constantly being shifted and moved to keep fluid paths through the dream realm. Oloch frequently holds festivals designed to create anchor points in the world of dreams. 

Archmage: Nyka

Nyka was one of the original scholars, and the first to grasp the horror of their great project. Some years after they all left Aton to found their great nations she began investigating deepest recesses of her own dreams and found the beast of shame, guilt, and paranoia that lurked there, and finally understood what they had all done. Try as she might to show the other archmages the truth, the others saw hers as a lesser school of magic and paid it little mind. 

  

The apocalypse happened in the dream world, contorting it largely into a realm of nightmare, before the physical end came about. Seeing this and knowing that it was too late, Nyka did what she could to create a safe haven in dream, creating the College of Dreams and leaving pre-recorded messages with advice in the dream realm in her wake. Now, she lies sleeping somewhere in the College of Dreams (this is not normal) locked in battle to keep the nightmares at bay from her safe haven, unable to affect it or offer any more guidance than what she left behind. 

Domains: Dream

Spells include the ability to pull entities of dream out of the dream realm, to physically enter the world of dreams, to contact others through dream, to travel through the dream realm. Dream magic can also be used to identify or discover the histories of objects through the imprint they leave on the dream. Dream magic can be incredibly powerful but usually carries complications and consequences along with it. 

Associated God: Mvos

God of dreams. 

  

## Nation: Jespark

Jespark is a large and rapidly expanding nation to the south, spanning the great desert and stretching all the way down to the southern sea. Vast and highly militaristic, the youngest of the seven great nations.

Archmage: Emperor Lutekai

Lutekai was not among the original scholars. A prince of the small nation of Jesparch, he was sent to study under the great alchemist Sorvald, but brought with him secret ambitions. Learning all that he could from his master he quickly developed techniques beyond what he had been taught, and though Sorvald had expected this intellectual union to result in an alliance with Jesparch in the future, Lutekai quickly sought to distance himself from his master upon claiming rulership of his nation and to create his own empire. This rift quickly put him at odds with other archmages, particularly Oana and Pyrus, who saw the threat to their hegemonic power, but Lutekai received unexpected aid from Cyrvo, who quickly declared an additional canon god and set to convincing the world that there had come about another rightful and ordained ruler. 

Domains: Forces, gravity, temperature

Spells include fireballs, great winds, conjured storms. Big, flashy confluences of the elements. 

Associated God: Vosderon 

God of the sea, much like Poseidon commonly associated with calamities and such.**
