The scribes keep careful record of all who enter and leave The Watch. Along with their name, a brief physical description, their profession or guild if they are a worker, their political status, and other pertinent details are all recorded. These records are a matter of public knowledge, and any citizen of The Watch may request a copy from The Scribes. The following political statuses would be recorded in these documents like a title alongside the name, and this is also how they are introduced and spoken about in The Assembly. 

  

The Assembly is held each evening and is when political matters are brought to the village. Most evenings these are small disputes that could not be settled by local communities, and normally only interested parties and ‘politicians’ attend.

  

Citizen

Citizen is considered the default political status in The Old Watch’s legal code, and for much of its history most adults who lived there were citizens. Recently, over half of The Old Watch’s population is now made up of residents and guests in the outer walls who have yet to attain full citizenship. 

  

In The Old Watch, citizenship is fundamentally an agreement about loyalty. The citizen swears their loyalty to the watch and its walls in the knowledge that the government is sworn to its citizens. All citizens are meant to have both equal say and stake in the governing of The Watch. 

  

Citizens of The Watch have several rights and responsibilities.

  

Rights of Citizens

- Citizens have the right to cast votes on all matters of general interest to The Watch
    
- Citizens have the right to submit any one name to any lottery for elected public office in The Watch (excluding those public positions granted to representatives of the major guilds, which are handled internally, most often by lottery of guild members). 
    
- Citizens have the right to the presumption that their oath is honest and has been kept in good faith. This is close to the concept of presumption of innocence but distinct in how it plays out in village politics. Citizens are presumed to be loyal, to be taken at their word, and to have the best interests of the village at heart unless it is proven otherwise before all. 
    
- Citizens have a right to be fed, housed, cared for in sickness, and protected in times of danger.
    
- Citizens who have toiled for The Watch for many years have a right to maintain their status as citizens in advanced age when they can no longer work.
    
- Citizens have the right to be provided with the work necessary to maintain their citizenship. The guilds are expected to train a steady stream of citizens and this training will count as labor for its duration. If no guilds are open to train citizens and if for whatever reason a citizen cannot find labor on their own, they may submit a request with the scribes and will be assigned to various tasks as needed. 
    
- Citizens have the right to come and go between the inner, middle, and outer walls at their whim except when The Knights deem it pertinent to halt traffic for the sake of security. 
    
- Any citizen has the right to take the oaths and swear themselves to service of the wall, gaining a noble name and heraldry of their choosing.
    

  

Responsibilities of Citizens

- Citizens are expected to devote ‘continuous toil’ to the welfare of The Watch. What counts as ‘toil’ is a heavily political matter, but for most people this means working for one of the major guilds.
    
- Citizens consent to fill positions of public office if their name is drawn in the lottery, even if they did not submit themselves for the position. 
    
- Citizens must be loyal to The Watch and its walls before any other obligation.
    
- When casting votes citizens swear to do so in the interest of what is best for The Watch as a whole before any sub faction of which they may be a part. This stipulation leads to a lot of accusations of treason when politics inevitably devolve into factionalism.
    
- Able bodied citizens are expected to train together and be prepared to fend off any incursions that breach the wall until The Knights arrive.
    
- Citizens must never live in undue comfort that could lead them down the dark path of nobility (another vague stipulation that often leads to accusations of treason and mudslinging).
    
- Citizens swear never to consort with dark forces or arcane powers.
    

  

Citizenship was established as a norm in the early years when the first outside refugees came to The Watch. It was agreed that these refugees would be cared for, but there were those who feared that these refugees would be loyal to the individuals who cared for them and took them in and upset the balance of politics in the village. Thus citizenship, which was at first assumed in The Old Watch’s laws, became an oath that had to be sworn and a vote had to be cast to grant citizenship to someone not raised within The Watch’s walls. 

  

Citizenship may also be revoked by vote. This rule came up when the high nobles first began shirking their duty of hard labor, and The Watch at the time did not believe this was a crime worthy of execution, but it was believed that these non-workers did not have a stake in the labor of the land and thus should have no say in how the land and resources were used. 

  

Resident

A resident is someone who lives permanently in the outer or middle walls, but is not a citizen. All children below the age of citizenship are considered residents until they take the oaths of citizenship. Residents are generally fed, as when food is doled out there is some that is provided to all residents, but their food is not guaranteed as it is for citizens. Similarly residents generally have a right to legal remedy and protection when they are wronged, but when it is the resident’s word versus a citizen’s the citizen’s is normally preferred because their oath of honesty and loyalty to The Watch is assumed to be honest in the absence of significant evidence otherwise.

  

Because of all this adult residents make up essentially an underclass in The Old Watch, and one that is rapidly expanding. Many residents do work for the guilds on the path towards citizenship. Residents who work with a guild are still entitled to the share of the food doles given to that guild each season and thus they are often equally well fed as citizens, but their position is more tenuous with the lack of work guarantees and the same legal rights. Because the guilds worry that other guilds will gain power by accepting large numbers of resident workers as citizens at once gaining a sudden political majority, in general the guilds agree to grant citizenship to equal numbers of resident laborers during the harvest season. Though the citizenship of each individual resident must be voted for before the assembly, the guilds each put forth applicants until this equality is reached. Others have their own private farms in the outer walls, which are allowed but are often subject to mistrust. 

  

Certain types of laborers not recognized by The Watch, such as chefs, are by default considered residents, but such residents are in a special class and are often still pillars of the community.

  

It is also notable that residents do not have the right to move between the walls and may be prevented for any reason, and generally unless there is a political matter that concerns a particular resident they are not allowed inside the inner walls during the assembly. 

  

Resident Friend

A resident friend is someone who has proven through action that they are a friend of The Watch, but still has not taken the oath of loyalty. This is usually offered to any outsider who has been offered citizenship but turned it down, or chefs, mages, and other types of outcasts who have through action proved their value to The Watch. Resident friends are generally allowed to move freely between the walls, but this is not guaranteed. Mages in particular are never allowed within the inner walls without an escort from the mage hunting division of The Scribes.

  
Resident friends are still unable to cast votes, but like citizens they are presumed to always be acting in the interests of The Watch until there is significant evidence otherwise. Though it is not encoded in law the food rations for resident friends are normally generous. In many ways this status confers many of the benefits of being a citizen without the responsibilities, and thus resident friends are occasionally looked upon poorly. 

  

Knight of The Wall

Knights of The Wall swear a different oath from citizens, one to protect the sanctity of The Wall and the lives of those inside it at all costs, and have a different batch of responsibilities. The Knights of The Wall are considered nobles, with the bold warriors who defended the walls being seen as the positive examples of the curse of nobility. As Nobles, they must be kept away from direct power lest the curse of nobility consume them and turn them into monsters.

  

Rights of Knights of The Wall

- Knights of the Wall, like citizens, are presumed to be honest to their oath until it is proven otherwise. 
    
- The presumption of sincerity extends to acts of violence from The Knights, who are assumed to have had a good reason unless sufficient evidence is provided to the contrary.
    
- Though Knights may not vote on political matters or engage in politics, they are always welcome to speak on matters of security of The Watch in the assembly, and their words are to be taken with due weight as The Watch’s protectors. 
    
- The Knights have the right to be fed and housed as other citizens. They are to be housed in barracks not too comfortable to prevent their curse of nobility from taking too much hold, but are to be fed in excess even when food is scarce to ensure that they are always strong of body. 
    
- The Knights are allowed to openly express their nobility and take pride in it (though more respect is often granted to those who do not adorn themselves too lavishly).
    

- Along with this nobility becomes heraldry and titles. Last names are not used in The Watch except by the Knights. Some trace their lineage back to the original lesser nobles who made up The Knights, but the majority these days are descended from peasants who swore themselves to the wall and chose their own surnames and heraldry after the revolution. A few are even descended from the high nobles, who otherwise revolted or were exiled during the early years of The Watch. Some swore themselves to the knights out of genuine conviction, others to escape this persecution. 
    

  

Responsibilities of Knights of The Wall

- The Knights of The Wall are expected to place the sanctity of the walls and the safety of those inside over all else, including their own lives.
    
- When a Knight takes the oaths of the wall, they commit not only themselves but their descendents to this life of nobility.
    
- The Knights are expected to take no interest in the political matters of The Watch except where these concern the security and sanctity of the walls. This goes beyond just not being able to vote, knights are not supposed to care about or speak on political matters except where they concern security.
    

  

Guest

Most of those who come to The Watch from the outside are first considered guests. Guests are to be treated with the utmost respect and kindness in the interests of The Old Watch’s diplomacy. A guest who turns up at the gates of the walls is always welcome inside except during times of severe conflict and strife, and entitled to be fed and housed unconditionally for up to three months during the spring, summer, and fall, and one month if they arrive during the winter. After this time if the guest wishes to stay they are moved to the status of resident and are expected to labor for their keep. Guests are generally expected to stay within the outer walls unless invited elsewhere, but are generally tended to by the scribes who give them frequent tours of the inner walls and explanations of Old Watch culture in the hopes that these guests one day integrate, for The Old Watch has come to rely on a steady stream of immigration as it expands. 

  

Foreigner

Funnily enough, the class of foreigner is rarely used for actual foreigners to The Watch, who are more often classified as guests when they arrive. It would be used for a diplomat from a foreign power The Old Watch is currently hostile to, but its primary purpose is to strip adventurers of their citizenship when they spend enough time outside the walls that their loyalty to their oaths becomes a matter of question. Foreigners are treated much like guests, with the additional expectation that they want something from The Watch. Classified foreigners are given the rights of guests not for a limited amount of time but instead until their petition is heard by the assembly. Usually in the case of adventurers this petition is to be reinstated as a citizen. 

  

Foreign Friend

A foreign friend is someone who The Watch understands is reliable and has put considerable effort into aiding The Watch, but either has chosen not to swear the oaths or has not yet been granted the opportunity. Adventurers are normally immediately granted the status as foreign friend when their petition is heard, as it is recognized they lost their citizenship in performing a task for The Watch. A foreign friend is considered similar to a resident friend, but their friendship to the Watch is assumed to potentially conflict with other loyalties on the outside. They are assumed to be acting in the interests of The Watch unless it is possible that this split loyalty could be driving their actions. Foreign friends are allowed to enter and leave the outer wall at will and without suspicion as it is assumed they have their reasons. 

  

Foreign Citizen

After a trial period as a foreign friend, adventurers are usually reinstated as foreign citizens if they choose, regaining all the rights and responsibilities of citizens while also being allowed to enter and exit the outer wall without suspicion. Still, the status as a foreign citizen does sometimes have negative connotations in comparison to regular citizens. Occasionally, this status is granted to actual foreigners who have done significant work for The Watch and declare The Watch as their primary loyalty. Importantly, the oath for a foreign citizen is different from the oath for a normal citizen. Foreign citizens are not asked to be loyal only to The Watch, just to swear that when loyalties conflict that they will always put The Watch first. This is because adventurers are important for The Watch’s diplomacy with the outside, and foreign citizens are even quietly encouraged to seek status and esteem among other groups of survivors. 

  

Liars

Liars are subject to several special political statuses within the old watch depending on the type and frequency of lies they are found to commit. Because The Old Watch relies on the honesty of oaths, lying can be considered a serious offense. This stipulation stems back from the days when nobles tried to subvert the democracy of The Watch, and was used as grounds to revoke citizenship. Still, it is understood that not all lies are equivalent and some liars can be loyal. Thus several classifications of lies and liars were created over the years.

  

The classifications of lies are

- Lies of Little Consequence: a lie of little consequence can be a boast, a white lie, or something else minor that does not affect the welfare of The Watch. Lies of little consequence alone are not enough to brand someone as a liar unless the volume of them is extreme, but can be used as supporting evidence alongside more severe lies. 
    
- Lies of Ignorance: Lies of ignorance are falsehoods told unintentionally. If someone would be convicted as a liar but it is found that they mostly engaged in lies of ignorance, they are given the status of fool rather than liar. 
    
- Lies of Greed: Lies with the purpose of gaining something, politically or materially, are considered lies of greed. Such lies are considered a serious offense, and multiple lies of greed can result in the revocation of citizenship.
    
- Lies of Malice: Lies intended to bring harm to others are considered akin to acts of violence and are a serious offense that can result in the revocation of citizenship, though scale is also considered. A lie of malice to one person is relatively minor, but if it effects more of the village this can be a more major offense than a lie of greed.
    
- Lies of Treason: The most severe type of lie that can result in execution even with no other supporting evidence that the person is a liar, lies of treason are lies that could harm the very foundation or security of The Watch. 
    
- Lies of Virtue: Sometimes, a lie is found to have been made for a good reason in the interests of The Watch, these are classified as lies of virtue. 
    
- Lies of Love: After the courts for branding citizens as liars were flooded with lover’s quarrels, the assembly no longer considers lies of love as evidence that one is a liar. There is now a separate process of paperwork with the scribes to file to have someone branded as a malicious lover, that only gets taken to the assembly when a quarrel is repeatedly escalated. 
    

  

Some severe lies result in stripping citizenship or even execution (which as always may at the accused’s choice be replaced by swearing oneself to The Inkbloods or The Scouts), while others simply result in being branded as a different type of liar:

  

Known Liar

A known liar is someone who has been found to repeatedly lie for no good reason, but to not do so in a way that causes great harm to the foundations of The Watch. Known Liars are always introduced with this as part of their title in the assembly and it is marked on their public records, but their citizenship is not revoked. It is understood that known liars are not harmful so long as all know of their affliction.

  

Known Fool

A known fool is one who is found to have repeatedly committed lies of ignorance, and is treated like a known liar, but more grace is generally given to known fools.

  

Licensed Liar

One who is found guilty of committing many lies, but these lies are mostly lies of virtue rather than being punished, is granted the title of “licensed liar”. For licensed liars, lies are no longer taken as signs of disloyalty on their own, as they are assumed to have a good reason unless assumed otherwise. They are still introduced as licensed liars though, which results in some suspicion of their words, even though those lies are never in themselves considered evidence against their character.
