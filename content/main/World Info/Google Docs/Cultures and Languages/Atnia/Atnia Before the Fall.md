Atnia was originally conceived in the fifth age, when it was thought that the Aulva had all been slain. It was thought of as a sort of holy land and seat of right power for a true empire that would reunite the world. But the jungles around it were thick and full of ogres and barbarous tribes that would set upon travelers. Many nobles were exiled under the guise of being granted a great honor of rulership of the kingdom of Atnia, attempted to build castles and keeps near the ruin, and ultimately had these fall to ruin. The mountains around the southern border are dotted with these ancient ruins, many of which would later become dungeons. 

Various cities can claim to be the oldest in Atnia. Aton of course is claimed by many to be the first city in the entire world, though its ruins were long inhabited by ogres and monsters. Oruva stakes its claim as a fishing village that existed by the sea for many years before the current kingdom attempted to settle the land, but the original village was further to the south of the current city, as Pyrus had it moved to match his plan for the symmetry of the nation. Liev was the first city founded by the noble rulers from Lekvia who sought to refound the great nation of Atnia, and served as the base of operations for the archmages as they fought their way to the ruins at Aton. 

The project to refound Atnia would have surely failed like all others before it were it not for the intervention of the archmages, and even still it might have failed had Pyrus not stayed behind after the other archmages scattered. Even outside of the ogres the indigenous population was hostile to any and all who built castles and walls. It was Oana who begged Pyrus to stay and to help the burgeoning government of Atnia to establish a true foothold, for she knew that as soon as the archmages left the ogres would return and all would be for nought. Lacking a home to return to and wishing to test his theories of government somewhere, Pyrus assented and offered his services to the King of Atnia, in short order assuming the position of Chancellor of Works. 

Pyrus built a city to represent each school of magic. Liev, the original seat of the capital, became the city of law. Aton as the origin of the elves would become a city dedicated to the understanding of history and magic itself. Oruva, due to its position on the coast, would become a city devoted to divination. Svet became a city focused on medicinal magic and chemistry, and the nameless city was created with all its winding alleys to create pathways into dream. The only city Pyrus did not order built himself was Myrkur, as Cyrvo settled it with his pilgrims before the borders of Atnia were set in stone, knowing that Pyrus would need that location to complete his circle and intending to use it for leverage. Pyrus quickly had the capital moved to Pax in the center, and began the work of creating a series of roads throughout the kingdom to both facilitate the flow of goods and to prevent or at least track unwanted travel.

Always in the ears of the kings and queens of Atnia stoking fear of rebellion, Pyrus isolated the high nobles from the rest of the nation in the center of the kingdom, convincing them to willingly refuse to leave and to set up laws to keep the peasants out. In addition to the normal roads, Pyrus set up a network of twelve crossroads where one of them must be passed in order to reach the center. Then, he created a binding spell to seal those crossroads in the event of an emergency, so that the capital could only be reached by a mysterious thirteenth crossroad that only he and the king and queen of the nation ever knew about. This thirteenth crossroad was the intersection between a series of underground tunnels he wove throughout the empire so that supplies could flow to the capital while it was under siege if such a thing were ever necessary. 

Pyrus set up strict laws and a caste system for his nation. With the gold nobility being those that bore a direct connection by blood to the royal line ruling over the silver nobility, which could be populated by peasants who committed great deeds for the nation and their descendents. The peasants made up the bronze caste and had very few rights with respect to the nobles, and weren’t even allowed to travel between villages without direct permission from the nobility. While Pyrus’s laws applied to all equally in theory, only the nobles truly know of them and have easier access to process the paperwork to be exempt from the red tape that keeps the peasants locked in their feudalist roles. 

The indigenous people of Atnia don’t disappear during this time. At first Pyrus attempts to approach them with treaties to join the land, and in some cases succeeds, but quickly after establishing a military foothold begins to outlaw their way of life, slowly pushing them to the borders of Atnia and into the mountains. A resistance forms in these mountainous regions, raiding supplies coming to and going out of Atnia where they can. In many ways this resistance serves Pyrus more than it hinders him, allowing him to fearmonger the nobles and push for even stricter control over the peasants. 

As the age of the archmages wears on adventurers come from various lands to delve into the dungeons that dot the mountainous regions, and many a great hero is crowned here (including the future queen Eudoxia, who is first known as a successful adventurer and hero slaying many a great monster in the Atnian dungeons). 

After the rise of Lutekai and his innovations in magical technology the tunnels under Atnia house autonomous trains, allowing supplies to flow to the center in theory without a single peasant ever being involved or allowed into Pax. In these later years the cult of the pale sun begins to form.
