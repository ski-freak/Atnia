It went by in a blink. Terrifying, yet painless. Devoid of bodily feeling. Pyrus’s eyes opened as he had known they would, though he had feared they would not. He breathed a sigh of relief. He had cheated death. Feeling began to return. His breath was at first jagged, and then easy. His body did bear the same aches of age as it had before. Something heavy weighed on his head and neck, pulling his vision to the ground.

Yet his surroundings were not as he had expected. All around him great hulking figures. He could not pull up his head to get a good look, but he knew them to be the Esmodae – The demons of law. Relief turned to resignation. He was alive, not a mere shade to be tormented here. He could feel that much. Yet he would have to cheat his way out of this realm once more. A nuisance. One of his own making, he knew as much. He had cheated them once before when he needed their power, and this was his promise. 

“What is to be my torment this time?” He did his best to affect a casual demeanor.

Booming laughter shook the flagstones on which he stood.

“What torment would we ever wish upon the esteemed Chancellor… or rather, King Pyrus.”

“I never took such titles.”

“They never escaped your lips, but they lived in your heart. And ours.”

“What…” 

Pyrus’s question died before it had even begun. He had lifted his hand to adjust the heavy something on his head, and saw the calloused grey of his skin. The size of his hand. He was in the body of an Esmodae. Slowly, his hand continued its journey to his head and felt the jagged metal pressing down his brow. 

“The king is dead.” Said the demon.

“Long live the king.” The room trembled again with the echo of a dozen booming voices.

“I see.” Said Pyrus. The demons were already filing out of the room. “So you will hold me here to rule your petty kingdom, and resist me at every step, to keep me from claiming mine on the surface. You think you can beat me at this?”

“My lord. It pains me to hear you speak so. Is this not the world you always dreamt of? Is their world not but a painful reflection of this one here. We will resist you yes at every turn, but only in reverence of the genius of your laws. To test their boundaries and provide you with the work you so loved. Have you so fallen for that fool Pontiff’s blathering that you would see only hell in your eternal paradise?”

And with that, Pyrus was again alone.
