 **-  Part 1: The Road to Aton
    

- Chapter 1: The Call to Adventure
    

- Follows Pyrus, Nyka, Augusta, and Sorvald as they are recruited by Oana to the upcoming expedition to Aton. Their reactions and how they make the decision to go, and ultimately setting out by boat towards the mainland.
    

- Chapter 2: Fireside Tales (Start of the road of trials)
    

- The boat arrives on the shore at dawn and the five begin their journey. The first night around the campfire Oana asks them all why they chose to come on the voyage to Aton. Some of the mercenaries speak a few words but most seem reluctant to truly bear their hearts. 
    
- Augusta appeals to her fellow soldiers, saying they need not be guarded around the scholars and they’ll all be brothers and sisters on an expedition here yet. She tells them all the story of her first time delving into an elvish ruin, the sense of fear and majesty, the monsters they encountered, and the bonds she formed with those who survived it with her. 
    
- Others start chiming in, and we learn about the backstories of a few of the mercenaries tonight. Everyone goes to sleep and agrees that those who had not yet told a story of themselves would speak the next day. 
    
- Another day of walking, and more tales in the evening. Sorvald tells his story about how his father made a fortune for himself but wasn’t clever enough to know what to do with it and died a successful but bitter man who never truly enjoyed the fruits of his labor. He speaks of wishing to enter the dungeon and learn from the elves what the true finer things in life are. 
    
- Pyrus shares stories of his home isle and how he grew up watching the debates in the assembly, all the languages and people that flowed through his land and his genuine desire to understand old elvish, the root of all that language and the first ever organization of people, and to better understand how they had ordered themselves to find truths that he could bring back to his home.
    
- Finally Nyka tells the story of Lug, but in a way that makes it their own. 
    

- Chapter 3: The Meaning of Lordship
    

- The party arrives in Liev, then a simple keep housing the King and Queen of Atnia. Though the party shows them the respect due to monarchs on their arrival, it becomes increasingly clear the titles mean very little. They feed their hosts spoiled meat and it is clear this is the best they have. Before they depart for the ruins at Aton they practically beg them to succeed, defeat the dungeon, and bring an end to the horrors that plague this land. 
    
- The party sets off, fed and resupplied, such that the Atnians could manage, and enter the deep jungle around the ruin. Soon they are beset upon by ogres. First by small bands and then increasingly large ones. It is all the mercenaries can do to fend them off, and the leader of the band urges the scholars to consider a retreat, that their forces are not large enough.
    
- Oana smiles and says that scholars ought not to be useless in military endeavors, and that if they put their heads together they ought to be more useful even than that many more swords. The scholars discuss how to use their terrain and the enemy’s tactics against them, though Nyka is oddly silent and despondent through this conversation.
    
- They concoct a plan and begin misleading the ogres, identifying their traps and turning them against them, using a combination of all of their talents. With their help the mercenaries manage to defeat larger and larger bands, pushing deep into the forest quickly and setting upon any ogres they encounter before they have time to react. A bloody trail behind them, the party finds themselves on the edge of the ruin at Aton.
    

- Chapter 4: Ogres and Ruins 
    

- The party camps outside the ruins and Oana tells her story of why she cares. Her brush with an ogre as a child and her glimpse of secrets in the Elvish ruin, the knowledge that something greater and more powerful lay deep within, and a hint that that thing might not be the type of treasure that any of them were expecting. This is where we learn that Oana has always been following a self-centered hero’s journey, that hers was a dark path from its first steps. Oana’s call to adventure was her pull to understand the magical world, but rather than let herself be a part of it she chooses to war with and take from it. 
    
- While the others chime in throughout this conversation and pepper Oana with questions, Nyka withdraws even further talking very little and saying odd bitter things when she does speak. 
    

- Part 2: The Ruin at Aton
    

- Chapter 5: The Threshold of the Other World
    

- The party enters the dungeon, after a short descent and some traversing, they find a deep pit blocking their way. Investigating the terrain they find that below them is deeper into the dungeon, where they wish to ultimately go. Further, that the floor here must have caved in recently, and they may be moving ahead further than ANY have been before (Sorvald speaks with excitement at this possibility). Sorvald rigs up a rope they can climb down deeper into the dungeon. 
    
- As they climb down into this deep cavern they begin to hear voices in the distance. Pressing through the darkness as stealthily as they can Augusta and some of the soldiers scout ahead, discovering a room filled with ogres in the dark. Returning, Oana has them gather the rest of the soldiers to sneak up on these ogres in the dark and use a sudden flame to blind them and set upon them. Augusta silently suppresses her doubts, some of the things she heard in the dark, these ogres sounded old, not quite like warriors. But she says nothing and does as she is told. The ogres put up no resistance, only Nyka dares say out loud that these were not warriors. Now Augusta has also failed her test, and she will continue to hold on to the vice of listening to authority and failing to avert the inevitable.

Micilanois notes:

  

Is there a growing hole in Aton? What, symbolizing the absence of the forest dragon? The absence in the soil which needs to be filled?

  

Wandering through the jungle not realizing that you’re already over Aton which is massive, but the jungle and solid have grown over so thickly it's hard to tell. The Ogres might have even worked with Goblin architects to engineer trees made to grow through and on top of the foundations of the giant cities' giant residential mounds. So you might be walking among the city's ancient spires and not even know it? Of course there were extensive tunnels dug under the mounds, where most of the people lived. Then as the mounds began sinking, and layers of sediment also began accumulating on top, what were above ground buildings become even more tunnels.**
