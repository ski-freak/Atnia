- All is dirt and all will return to dirt
- Consciousness is a mirror and a fractal, reflecting but distorting the same ideas across time
- Life must consume death to subsist (Sorvaldâ€™s truth)
- The past is dead, there is only the present
- The past is contained within the present
- All life is a part of something greater, and is composed of things lesser. Dragons are to us as we are to bacteria. Bacteria are as dragons to still tinier beings, and dragons are as bacteria to still greater ones.
