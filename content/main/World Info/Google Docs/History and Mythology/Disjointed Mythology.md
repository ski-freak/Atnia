The Legend of Zoggir
Culture(s): Orcs (almost worldwide) and humans, goblins, and even a few ogres who live closely with orcs.

Zoggir is the orcish god-hero of storytelling, heroism, and boasting. Zoggir’s legend is meant to communicate the teller’s opinions about the nature of heroism. Zoggir’s gender is normally the same as the teller, and Zoggir usually hails from the teller’s tribe. Zoggir’s story is based on some amount of truth, as there really was a great famine among the orcs after the collapse of the ogre empire that ended in the slaying of a dragon. Some elements of the story are always common and rarely change, while others are completely malleable. 

The teller always begins the legend of Zoggir by insisting that everything the listener has heard about Zoggir is a lie (perhaps even that someone who just told the story must have got that slander from Zoggir’s enemies). During the great time of famine many bands of orcs had gathered together to form a vast army with the sole purpose of hunting down a dragon for its power before they starved. But as is often the case with great organizations made by the other species, somehow the leaders of this army were only the most incompetent and egotistical from among the orcs. Zoggir was a young warrior from (usually when the story is told the teller inserts their own tribe). Usually, Zoggir is a braggart who insults the leaders of the great army claiming that they could do better, but some tellings of the story differ. Regardless, the leaders of the army wish to see Zoggir dead for this insolence and send them on six seemingly impossible tasks. These tasks differ in the telling but common favorites include moving a mountain out of the way of the great army (sometimes Zoggir splits the mountain in two with a single blow, other times they rearrange the camps in the middle of the night such that the army is facing another direction and the incompetent leaders are none the wiser, among myriad others). Each time though through some feat of might, diplomacy, or cleverness Zoggir prevails. Finally, Zoggir has won the support of the entire army and it is clear they will soon revolt against their leaders. In anger the leaders say “fine, if you’re so amazing slay the dragon yourself, why do you need our army in the first place?” To which Zoggir replies something like: “I could do it myself, but without the help of my brothers and sisters I would surely die performing the task.” Of course it is eventually agreed that Zoggir will do it alone, and through some mixture of cleverness and strength they accomplish the task dying in the process just as they predicted.

The Legend of Ystosk and Kluatra
Culture(s): Atnian orcs, and to a lesser extent indigenous humans who live with them and share the same gods, though these are never so popular as Zoggir among non-orcs. 

[Todo: tell more detailed story]

Ystosk and Kluatra were 

The story of Ystosk and Kluatra is one of great tragedy and revenge, where their children and families are slaughtered in unimaginably cruel ways. Thereafter they swear vengeance for their great wrong, he always laughing a horrible sick laugh and she always weeping. They channel the power of these emotions to avenge their grievances. As is somewhat abnormal for orcs they lie and kill indiscriminately on the way to their goal, though the listener is meant to empathize with them and understand this as a case where such emotions are necessary following the path of these heroes without dire need is frowned upon and they are both associated with treachery as much as heroism. Importantly for the lesson the latter half of the story is them both learning to live afterwards and escape the laugh-madness and horrible sadness that afflicts them.



How Hands Came from the Winds
Culture(s): Goblins, and maybe a couple ogres pay some attention to it
This story is incredibly old and likely has its own wide variety of details and tellings around the world. 

Once, the great creatures of land all ran on four feet, and the little creatures ran on six or eight feet. The creatures knew of hands, for the winds had them. There were four winds. Shiso used her hands to carry heat and cold from north to south and south to north. Zofa used her hands to carry seeds and plants from the northeast to the southwest and the southwest to the northeast. Wishra used her hands to carry the waves from east to west and west to east. Klethna used her hands to carry the clouds from southeast to northwest and northwest to southeast.

And this all worked very well for a time but with all the rushing around they were doing to carry out their tasks they kept running into each other and taking one another’s charges. Shiso and Zofa would collide and all of a sudden seeds would be taken to the north while the cold was taken to the southwest. Or Wishra and Klethna would collide and the clouds would go west while the waves went northeast. 

So the father of the winds, Achtha, thought that he might help by using his hands to boost them up and down so they were not all running into each other all the time. So Zofa might be high in the sky when Shiso was going by low to the ground. And this too worked well for a time. 

But Achtha, whose hands his children had inherited, was not content to use his hands merely to carry out his duties to the flow of the world. While he and his children were going about their task he saw an opportunity to ensure some seeds of grapes were planted in a great wide valley, and that Shiso never passed them by too low with air too cold, and that Klethna and Wishra always brought them water and minerals to grow healthy and strong.

And when these grapes were ripe Achtha set to picking them, but in his wisdom and patience he did not eat them. Instead waiting for thousands and thousands of years until their juice was good and ready. And this first wine became the greatest ever made (it is the vintage the gods still drink to this day in the heavens!). But Achtha had not thought to share it yet, for he was simply having the first sip of wine and he did not yet know that it was better shared with friends. Nor did he know the effect it would have on his mind.

In a drunken stupor, Achtha tried to keep helping his daughters out with their task, but he could not seem to get his timings right. They crashed into each other again and again, rousing one of the greatest storms the world had seen. Seeing that this was not good, the four daughters put their father to bed and set about doing their work on their own again as best they could.

As they worked again they got to talking, and decided that they could perhaps use other helpers than just their father. Shiso chose monkeys to be her helpers, and granted them hands that they might carry fire to the cold parts of the world and ice to the warm. Zofa chose bees and wasps and flies, and granted them hands that they might help to spread plants along her path. Wishra chose hyenas, giving them hands so that they might sail the seas and use oars with their strong limbs to push the waves. Klethna had a difficult task for finding one that could push clouds, but after some thought chose to give hands to a bear, which spent much of its time in sleep and could use its hands to push the clouds in its dreams.

Achtha still slept, and seeing that predators and pests were being granted hands a small fearful lizard snuck up in his stupor and swiped his so that it might have a chance at evading its new enemies. 

How the Insects Took Hair and Scales
Culture(s): Goblins

Now of the creatures with hands the ogres, orcs, and humans all had thick hair that kept them warm in the winter, and the goblins were covered in sharp protective scales that made them tougher to claw or bite into. The insects had no such thing, and lacking in both hair and scales they would freeze more often in the winter, and were easily eaten by their predators. And so they got to thinking, what with how small they were, that even if they had a tiny bit of the hair and scales the bigger creatures with hands had they could do much more with it. They even dreamed of ways they could use hair to sense the world around them, and scales to store water on their backs. And so their jealousy finally turned to entitlement: they could use these things much more than those who had them, and they would barely miss them if they were gone. So all the insects of the world gathered to make a plan to trick the bigger creatures out of their hair and scales.
	So first the insects whispered in the ears of goblins that they should hold a contest for all the creatures in the world, a grand tournament to see who would be the fastest, strongest, and most intelligent and whoever won would get to make a request of the others. The goblins, being sure that through their cleverness they could win any such contest, begin the work of organizing it and calling all the species together. 
	First all of the species engage in a race. Only the goblins even realize the insects are competing, and at first all think that the humans won. But the arbiters quickly determine that a moth crossed the finish long before anyone else. The next contest is one of strength, and each of the species engage in an arm-wrestle. Three bees – one for each species, sacrifice themselves by stinging the hand of their opponent to get them to yield. And the insects win another round. 
	Finally comes a contest of wit, as each species asks the others a riddle until finally one can come up with an answer that all others must accept but none can guess before it is revealed. The humans and orcs are now angry after their defeat in contests they felt they should have one, and complain that the insects must speak through the goblins and cannot give the riddles themselves, and finally after some discussion the insects are disqualified from this contest. Quickly however the humans and orcs are outmatched by the wit of the goblins and the knowledge of the world of the ogres, who go on telling each other riddles for many hours before finally the ogres emerge victorious by a hair in the dead of night.
	The insects, having won two of the three contests, get to make a request of the other species, and they ask for the hairs of the ogres, orcs, and humans, and the scales of the goblins. Since the ogres won one contest, they may make a counter-request, and the ask that the insects allow each of them to keep some of their favorite hairs and scales so that they might still feel as themselves. The insects graciously assent, for they never needed very much hair or scales in the first place. And this is how beetles got their shells and bees and flies and many other things got their hair, and how it came to be that humans are the only monkeys without hair over their whole body, orcs are the only hyenas with large patches without fur, and ogres came to be the only bald bears. And of course how goblins came to only keep the most important scales on their backs. 

How Insects Became so Small
Culture(s): Goblins
Covers the first great magical empire of the world created by the insects. Maybe this story should be told more indirectly through the earliest goblin myths involving giant insects and then suddenly in later ones they are much smaller – originally solitary creatures, hints at them talking about their lost “first hive”
