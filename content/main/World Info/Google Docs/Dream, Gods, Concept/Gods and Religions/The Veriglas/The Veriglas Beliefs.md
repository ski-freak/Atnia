The Veriglas believe that there is one true pantheon, and that many of the gods worshiped around the world are just aspects of gods in this true pantheon. They believe that the elves knew of these true gods, and once all people around the world were one under their rightful leadership, but that through our own greed and pride we splintered into two kingdoms, and then more and more over time losing our united culture and forgetting the correct way of life taught to us by The Elves. The Veriglas buys into the theory that the elves were killed by The Horned Legion, who represent the raw force of mortal lust and greed and cast us into this sorry state where we are doomed to make pale reflections for the great kingdom of The Elves and war with each other, never understanding that we are all truly one and the same peoples. 

The Veriglas has a pantheon of those they believe to be true gods. Gods are always good and benevolent towards mortals, and they rationalize the darker stories of these gods by creating alternate demonic enemies for them. According to The Veriglas mortals were created by the gods who exist on a plane above us, and no mortal can ever become a god – though through service gods might recruit mortals to be their saints or angels in death, or through wicked deeds a mortal might become a demon when they die. Once there were only gods and no dark demonic forces, but the horned legion in their greed created the first dark god and became the first demons. Notably the resistance to mortals becoming gods makes basically all orcish gods heretical, and they are often considered simply to be demons.

For the modern Veriglas there are seven high gods, who live in the house of heaven and rule over all the others, but there are many many more minor gods. The major gods are each directly tied to an archmage, and this pantheon was created as the high gods to add a sense of spiritual legitimacy to their rule. 

Hwain, God of Magic: Hwain was the first of the gods, and created the elves in his own image. He rules over magic and represents a sort of enigmatic Odin-like figure. The magic of Hwain and the Elves are understood as something separate from the dark magic and witchcraft that was practiced within the age of magic. These false magics are all ultimately based on the dark nameless god of evil created by the horned legion. Hwain was the king of the gods in the age of the elves, but has since given the reigns of power to his son Ozen. Associated with Oana and history/elven magic.

Tta, Goddess of Mirrors: The wife of Hwain, the old elvish goddess Tta governs mirrors, foresight, and the connections between all things. Mother of the elves and queen of the gods in their time, she is now the grandmother of the pantheon. Associated with Agusta and scrying/divination magic.

Ozen, God of the Sun: Ozen is an amalgamation of the various sun heroes around the world, the current king of the gods and father of humanity. He is brash, heroic, and just, often charging in before he is ready, but always meaning well when he does so. Associated with Cyrvo and divine magic.

Mvos, Goddess of Dream: Wife to Ozen. While Ozen sees the true righteousness of things under the blinding light of day, Mvos deals with subtle matters of heart and community hidden in the subconscious. She is the whisper in the ear telling you the right thing to do, even when you wish not to hear it. According to The Church, Nyka is quite literally a prophet of Mvos. 

Vosderon, God of the Sea: Another god that has been around since the time of The Elves, Vosderon represents the benevolent side of calamities and change. Vosderon washes away the old so the new may be born. Associated with Lutekai and physics magic.

Braeg, God of the Forge: Braeg is the god of the forge, invention, and creation. Often said to be the father of goblins. He is Ozen’s more educated and industrious brother, and is frequently portrayed as the one holding the palace of the gods together. If Ozen is the heart of the pantheon, Braeg is the head (as is Hwain sometimes, but he’s often portrayed as carrying a wisdom deeper but madder than simple knowledge). Associated with Sorvald and medical/chemistry magic.

Oln, God of the Dead: Oln is the judge of the dead, weighing their worth on his scale and guarding the gateway to the afterlife. He is the master of the ferrymen to the land of the dead, who must be payed a coin on one’s departure if one wishes them to put in a good word with the judge. He is careful and meticulous and is associated with both law and commerce as well. Third brother alongside Braeg and Ozen. Associated with Pyrus and law magic.

Outside of this main pantheon, commonly venerated gods in the church include:

Lug, God of Light and Heroism: The old stories of Lug that cast him as a mortal first are but lies, Lug is the light in the darkness, the hero who stands when no one else has the courage. Some hard liners in the church see too much overlap with Ozen and believe them to be one, but adventurers the world around worship Lug, and it suits the church to acknowledge him. After all, there is ample evidence the elves venerated this figure as well.

Eda and Abon: The god and goddess of marriage, trust, and promises. Venerated in wedding rights, of course, but also in signing of contracts or in rituals of building community. 

Also need to think up dark forms of many of the gods, as the darker side of hero gods become the demon villain foil to Ozen, truly horrific calamities become the foil to Vosderon, etc…
