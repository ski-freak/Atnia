1. The old palace, built into the sheer cliff face of the mountain this is now used as the entrance to the mines as well as to house the town assembly and the defense council. These are not prestigious or comfortable dwellings, as leadership is not considered a prestigious position. 
2. The town square where votes for all of the old watch citizenry are held. Major shops and businesses surround this square with a statue to the knights that sacrificed themselves during the apocalypse in the center.
3. The tangle. As the population of the inner wall began expanding an urgent need for more housing came about. Before the creation of the second and third walls The Tangle had already started to grow — a warren of stacked homes connected by ladders and bridges, connected to further dwellings in the palace and carved out of the side of the mountain. These dwellings are prestigious as they are within the inner wall, but many prefer to live in the second layer of walls where there’s more space and less climbing. Only members of the oldest families of the peasant democracy live in the larger dwellings in the inner wall (and these are mostly far from mansions).
4. The main barracks for the knights of the wall, built after the second wall’s construction.
5. The second wall was made primarily to defend these farms that became a necessity outside of the inner wall as the population began to grow. 
6. The village in the middle wall is the most populous part of the old watch. Still only open to full citizens of the watch, while it offers less prestige many prefer to live here outside of the clutter and drama of the inner wall. 
7. Within the outer wall is a prominent tent city constructed by various travelers that come and go, including the scouts. Those who stay longer and perhaps seek citizenship create more permanent dwellings within the outer wall. 
8. At the behest of the scribes, knights, and herbalists, a fair portion of forest within the third wall was left unclear. The knights wanted emergency lumber in case of a prolonged siege, and the scribes and herbalists saw several uses to this ecosystem within lands that were safe to walk.
9. The sheer cliff face the wall has been built into has a peak, and there is a prominent fear of monsters scaling down that face. In response the watch has begun its most dangerous and expansive construction project yet: the high wall extending along the mountains peak. A current item of great controversy as several builders have already died.
10. Though those who worship the walls view it as the most sacred, the inner wall might be the least practically effective of the walls. Old and in some amount of disrepair, many of the knights don’t see it as a serious bastion of defense. Especially since if the outer two walls fell the force would likely be great, and food would quickly dwindle. It may have some magic from Pyrus enchanting it though, and potentially even be a nascent god from the worship it receives.
11. The middle wall was the fist of the great feats of engineering of the builders, and represents the watch’s most serious line of defense in case of a real threat. 
12. Compromises had to be made with the sheer size of the outer wall. It has significant vulnerabilities in some places and it takes time to mobilize knights to any particular part of it. Monsters breaching this wall has happened a few times since its construction though it has been rebuilt stronger after each incursion.
