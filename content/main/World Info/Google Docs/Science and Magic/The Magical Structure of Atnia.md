Atnia is built as a great magical focus, a vortex that funnels the magic of the world into the seat of power at the center. 

Pax, The Garden of Peace: The last of the great cities in Atnia, created after the surrounding circle had been completed. Pax housed Pyrus’s tower, as well as the gated palaces of the high nobility, who often lived out their lives without ever encountering a true peasant. Focuses on all types of magic. The city is designed as a perfect flawless garden, a microcosm of the philosophy under which the whole kingdom was built. Nothing is out of place, and it has an eerie almost inhuman quality to it. 

Liev, The City of Libraries: The first city in the kingdom of Atnia, as this city began with the keep by the king and queen before the archmages arrived. When Pyrus had the capital moved to the center at Pax, he kept Liev as the seat of law in Atnia. If Pax is a reflection of Pyrus the archmage, Liev is a reflection of Pyrus the human. The winding cobble streets are easy to get lost in, but also to find oneself when one needs. A seemingly impossible number of museums and libraries break up the houses and shops, and even those who have lived their whole lives there still find new troves of knowledge to uncover. The whole city is built around the old castle that now serves as the seat of the supreme court of Atnia. Focuses on law and language magic.

Aton, The Great Ruin (The Endless Ruin after the apocalypse): Another city with claim to be the first settlement in Atnia, of course the oldest ruin once inhabited by the elves. A city has been built on top of the adventuring economy, and the archmages themselves have set up illusions and traps to prevent any adventurers from unlocking the true secrets stored within (bypassing this has to have been a right of passage for Lutekai, right?). The city operated on an adventuring/tourism economy before the collapse. Focuses on magic magic/elvish magic/history of magic. 

The Nameless City: The Nameless City is designed to unmoor you from the physical plane. Streets are designed at slight angles and curves to confuse the senses and allow the mind to wander. After the apocalypse the city disappears entirely, merging in with other buildings focused on encouraging dream magic to create The College of Dreams. The College of Dreams should occasionally be physically located where The Nameless City was, but quickly disappear back into the dream realm or the other physical locations it was drawn from. The Nameless City focuses on dream. 

Myrkur: Myrkur was settled by pilgrims from The Veriglas before the archmages had fully declared their borders, a ploy by Cyrvo to hold sway in Pyrus’s land. Pyrus has done his best to integrate it with his plan for the nation. Focuses on divine magic.

Svet: A small rustic town containing the premier college for doctors in Pyrus’s empire. Focuses on Sorvald chemistry magic. 

Oruva: Also arguably the first city in Atnia, Oruva was a small fishing village that survived on the coast for many years. Technically this isn’t the original city, as Pyrus had the whole thing moved further inland to match with his perfect symmetry. Uses the proximity to the ocean to house observatories for divination magic. 

The Twelve Crossroads: The crisscrossing roads of the kingdom meet in twelve places. These crossroads contain magical wards, and are the first hurdle that must be passed to reach Pax. They are focal points for tracking travel and the magical enforcement of law and space. 

The Thirteenth Crossroad: It is said that the thirteenth crossroad must be reached to arrive at Pax when it is locked down in times of strife. This crossroad is underground, and is truly the supply train that runs under Atnia. Each of the twelve crossroads technically has access to the thirteenth, but the path is normally blocked and warded except when the train is scheduled to move through. 


The nature of a thought fermenting: This is the reason that we can’t think about ideas and have to let them sit, We are creating a dream totem in our heads. A dream totem is a piece of pure art on the outside, and an intricate machine on the inside. It is a machine built to 1) Erase itself perfectly. Only the outside facade and very inner core remain 2) Reconstitute itself perfectly. 3) Create and detect minor tremors in the void and as the dream and physical world expand and contract. Travelers are able to use these to travel from the material plane to the dream realm. The inner mechanisms are meant to self immolate sending ripples in their specific signature through the void where the data can be picked up and coded into matter in the dream realm where matter naturally forms around thought. That’s not the sort we’re building when we are fermenting a thought however. We reverse engineer empty dream totems waiting to be filled, stealing “random” parts from the dream world. I say random, but we can at least influence the results. This is why we can’t think about an idea while it is “fermenting”. We are building up and shaping the negative space in our minds until we have created both its facade and its heart. Matter doesn’t naturally gather around thought in the material plane, so an immense amount of energy is required to recreate a person. Matter is compressed and stored in the heart of the totem, but in a way that is unrecognizable, even antithetical to our physical selves. Like an infinite peace of paper that doesn’t know how to unfold itself and so is bound in space. But when the traveler leaves the dream world, the void rushes in to reclaim its foothold there. The ripple created by the expanding void will be picked up and read by the totem and if it all matches up the infinite paper will all unfold exactly right. The matter that had been compressed will snap back to its original position with immense force, enough to cause a huge explosion if it weren’t for the facade keeping all of the matter within its bounds. The totem uses this contained boom of energy to reconstitute your matter, and voila: you appear. This ‘boom’ of power is why we get so many thoughts when an idea snaps into place.


What if all of Atnia is in the dream world after the apocalypse?

So when Atnia is first settled by the Ogres it is half plains and half forest. The death of the forest dragon is a clear marker on those scales and so affects the entire world, even if there are other forest dragons. The battle between plains and forest will also echo that of void and dream.

Sorry I am so tired, this list might be really wrong. In fact I think that it might be. You don’t have to look at it until i’ve had some sleep and taken a look back
1. Atnia is settled by ogres
2. Atnias soil is enriched, and the forest covers the whole valley
3. Hard winter hits and the forest fades and is cut down for fire to keep warm. Still the ogres are dying.
4. The forest dragon saves them by collecting large animals from far off and depositing them.
5. The forest resurges stronger than ever. Atnia is a plentiful and diverse place, but not the easiest to traverse. (I need to figure out how and where rivers would likely form, but first I have to figure out how the mountain range was formed as well)
6. Another climate catastrophe hits and the now large Ogre settlement comes beseeching the dragon for help. So they murder and eat the dragon, becoming it, with all of its pain and hard earned lessons to come.
7. Atnia became the natural center of trade in foods, medicines, and fine arts. The Ogres spread and begin learning to shape the land elsewhere to restore greenery, but this ultimately fails and the originals all begin their journeys back to Aton to deliberate.
8. Ogres take a while with such things, and when they are done, they emerge ten thousand years have passed and not much of it for the better. They tear apart every remaining toxic power structure they can find and drive it into the ground, and begin deeper plans. They had planned on feeding themselves back to the dragon to undo their sin, but now realize that this isn’t enough. They had become the forest dragon and spread its seeds across the world not knowing that they were tainted. It might be impossible for an ogre to die of old age, and so they sit underground and wait. Talking with the roots and the bugs and each other about the fate of the world, waiting for the soil to take them, but it won’t because they have work left to do.
9. Briefly a goblin takes over the entire world and thereby becomes a “dragon”(Perhaps just a dream god).  Being a dragon with control over mortals the Ogres reach out through the dream realm (or on the material plane as well, idk) and basically ask him to hit the big old reset button and annihilate everyone who tries to build a society of substantial size for the next thousand years. Understandably the New Dragon declines this rather impossible offer and disappears from the limelight for the next  thousand years, learning and gaining perspective from the shadows. Now that it has observed a large swath of history it see’s that the Ogres weren’t wrong about mortals, but it also believes that they weren’t exactly right either. It decides that society has been crafted to accumulate and consolidate power for tens of thousands of years, and that it’s not possible to attack such an entity in the material realm that is made of void as void is more powerful here. Society consolidates that power and hoards it. Where does power go when it is hoarded and not planted? No where. It disappears. Corporations and Nation States are not entities made up of a single person or small groups, but entities fashioned from entire peoples stitched together, regardless of shared history or culture. It is an entity which does nothing beyond looking after its own interests. It keeps itself safe while it expands for no other purpose than to consume all of life. With traditional Goblin genius the first archmage, the new dragon decides that the answer isn’t to grind the gears to a halt by pulling against them, but to turn them faster and faster beyond capacity until the entire machine breaks down. That’s how you kill the unkillable machine that is made only of void: let it win. And prepare for the aftermath. Classic Goblin. The new dragon creates tributaries along natural and societal laylines to collect the souls of the deceased and put them back into the earth, stronger and more resilient than before. You can see the New dragon taking a similar position to the ogres before that all. Even in the beginning in its relative inactivity, it works to pull magic from society back into the soil before realizing it has to temporarily do the opposite to overload the system. That’s when magic becomes scarce and Immortality only a fable. Anyways the First Archmage, the New Dragon is able to use all of the death from the (technically minor) apocalypse to feed the mass of empty dream totems, “repaying the debt” and giving the dreams the energy that they needed to manifest all of the minds that had been stored in the dream realm. With that snap came a booming of energy and unfortunately the energy could not be contained by the massive network of dungeons under the ground, but came exploding out the top. All that’s left of Atnia is a massive sinkhole at the bottom of an even larger crater. By all accounts Atnia literally got blown off the map. The forests can now begin to return, but at the cost of a nation. All that’s left is the nameless city, still nameless, still ever shifting below the ground. The caverns which lead to it are constantly caving in and shifting making getting there a suicide mission. Of course the crater/sinkhole are the negative spaces where Atnia used to be. Is the heart of Atnias dream totem the Nameless city; the ever shifting tunnels below? And then the mountains, “the facade” of the totem? Meaning that Atnia could still possibly come back from dream? Would that be ok? Were they just blown there by happenstance or is there further significance to Atnia being gone and in the dream world? This all definitely needs work but I need to sleep now

How do younger or older ogres that have a normal mortal perception of time play into this? If you live for so long your thoughts change. Become slow and precise. But what about the Ogres who would've learned from this culture but chosen to live mortal lifespans play into all of this? I can see why they’d choose it. When you’re being slaughtered you need to be quicker on your feet.


So the land around Aton was filled with thriving societies for thousands upon thousands of years while the Ogres rested underground. At first these societies would be feeding the natural order, but eventually shift away from it. The ogres who go down to discuss can essentially turn into stone while they do so. I think that maybe those who go down to die are not able to; that the soil will not not accept them back, and so like the plants before them that never knew how to rot and become oil, they remain and become like stone. The soil won’t accept them until they fulfill their debt, and it was their mistake to think that they could do so with their bodies alone. I think that maybe they become living Dream totems. Just a core and a stone outside containing void, while they live in the dream world. This is how they speak directly with the earth and the plants and everything. And also why it takes them so long to do so. On top of many ogres being super ancient and time going by quicker for them, time also operates very differently in the dream realm, which could explain the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of years on hiatus. Hundreds of thousands of years for societies being born and dying in the same place, sometimes feeding the land, more often taking from it, but all on top of these ancient dream totems. Those that died there who had taken rather than given were not allowed to return to the soil like the ogres but became ghosts and dream totems of their own. Growing the absence in the material plane, but adding to the wait of the dream world. The absence in the material plane manifesting under Aton caused it to perpetually sink, meaning that the societies built there would never reach the heights of the mountain summits surrounding them, or never maintain such a height for long, but instead become the soil, however weak; Just miles and of “hollow earth”. Endless cavernous ecosystems, but never enough to pay the original debt of a soil so fertile and so left hungry and clawing at the world of the living.


Also an archmage familiar turning into its own dragon? An octopus?

When dragons are slain or otherwise disappear, they manifest in the dream world while they wait to return to the material plain. Could this echoe or relate the relationship between glaciers and volcanic eruptions? (Does more pressure mean more or less eruptions? Less, right?)

So all these powerful dream totems are all at the bottom most foundation of perhaps the oldest and most successful society

The void dragon
