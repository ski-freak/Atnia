To understand how immortality can occur in the world of Nightmares, we have to understand the rules core to the universe regarding death:
- Everything dies
- Death is permanent
- The past is dead and cannot be directly returned to
- However, the past is contained within the present, albeit distorted
- There are two types of death, death as in the dying and recycling, the core concept of dirt to the world, and the utter obliteration that happens in the void. Ironically the death of the void is in a sense more reversible, because the void which seeks to consume all often chooses not to fully digest that which it consumes, only consuming the parts that cling to the realm of the living so that it may be sent back as a shade of the void, to go back into the physical world and collect more matter to bring to it.


If youâ€™re casting the archmages into the void, would it not return them as emissaries?
