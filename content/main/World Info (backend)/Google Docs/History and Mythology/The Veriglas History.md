The Veriglas, or the ‘true church’, was a religion originally conceived in the sixth age on The Twilight Isle by exiled nobles who had failed to reclaim their promised kingdom of Atnia. The founder of the religion was Gaius Tetlok, one of the many ‘kings of Atnia’ crowned in Jespark to get rid of popular but troublesome nobles. 

Gaius had always dreamt of ending the constant feuds and wars in his homeland, but upon his banishment had no power to do so except in letters. He argued time and time again with his fellow nobles that they were less different than their enemies than they thought, and finally in frustration put a full articulation of his thoughts to pen in his old age. He did not intend at the time to start a religion, but simply make a final and incontrovertible argument for peace.

His book: Discourses on the Scattering of Peoples, argued that all in the world had been one people long ago under the rulership of the elves. He argued that the first sin was separating into two empires, and each separation since had been a greater sin on the vision the elves had for a whole world society. Furthermore, these divisions created artificial boundaries between things that were truly the same. He drew on examples from history and across culture to show that many gods worshiped in different places were truly one and the same. He used these examples to argue the existence of a true pantheon of the elves that we had all long since strayed from, and argue that the petty divisions of religion and culture were counterproductive to returning to this ideal root.

It is only by an odd accident of history that this book was ever circulated, for Gaius was dying in squalor and his older fame had long been forgotten. By chance however, he happened to anger the wrong noble in his home in Jespark, and an assassin was sent to the Twilight Isle to kill him. And kill him he did, robbing what little possessions the old man had. The assassin Soul Henrickson boarded a ship to return to his homeland, at the time feeling little remorse. The voyage was ill fated, being buffeted off the coast multiple times by storm and running out of supplies with no ability to reach dry land. Bored and starving, Soul had nothing to do but read the discourses, which bled into his hallucinations and dreams. When the ship finally arrived in Jespark he was a changed man, claiming to have seen visions of the true nature of the world and telling all who would listen of the way of peace advocated by Gaius, and of the assassination he had been hired to carry out. 

He quickly developed a cult following among those dissatisfied with the Jespark monarchy, but they were all quickly exiled and found themselves wandering and scattered, largely in the Hellas region.
