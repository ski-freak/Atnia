Passive AC versus Active AC

Movement tokens? 

Different AC for each facing

—---- next version —---

Start combat with 3 active reactions (if not surprised) 

Start combat in a stance. Main stance types are: Wrath, Guard, Flow, Focus, Prone, Air

Stances also have movement pools on them

Moves transition you between stances. Most moves have a starting stance and a potential ending stance. Often they can start from multiple or end in multiple. 

Attacks and maneuvers have a movement section for whether movement is possible. Blank for movement is not possible / for half movement, and X for full movement allowed. Moves allow you to move up to either full or half the move allowed by the stance.

Normally movement is one to one, but all characters also have a threat radius determined by their spacing and stance. Moving into one of these spaces costs double. You can  move into these spaces without paying the extra movement, but the threatening character gets a free attack. 

Defense is different based on your facing, defense for all facings is determined by armor and stance.
