## Notes on Ogres
Ogres are a carnivorous sapient species that stand about half-again the height of humans. As mammalian carnivores, ogres have canines on the sides of their incisors, and a relatively simple digestive tract with a large amount of bile and acid to help with digesting fat and killing any ingested bacteria. Ogres have wide, rounded tongues with more dorsal mobility than mobility in the tip. They tend not to produce sounds that require mouth rounding or move the tip of the tongue much. A healthily nourished adult ogre will generally have a robust layer of fat in addition to muscle. Ogres tend to weigh four to six times as much as humans.

Ogres reach physical maturity at about the age of 10, and naturally live into their 70s (though in the hunter-gatherer era they rarely would, as physical decline becomes more serious in their 50s). 

Like the other sapient races, ogres initially organized in bands of hunter-gatherers. However their need for large quantities of meat meant that times of surplus were usually short-lived as an immediate hunting environment cannot sustain a large population of ogres. Often a group of youth would be pushed to form a new tribe, or mass starvation would occur. This pressure pushed ogres to create agrarian societies before any of the other sapient races, maintaining vast herds of goats, oxen, and other livestock. 

## History
Classical Xwauda came about during a significant time of change for its speakers. Previously, Ogres had lived in small tribes distributed across the landscape, including a handful of small agrarian settlements. These settlements, which needed to keep large herds of livestock for food, often had surplus of leather goods among other animal products. 

## Phonology
The vowel inventory is /i, iː, ə, əː, ɑ,  ɑː/ romanized to < i, iː, u, uː, a,  aː>. Long vowels will be explicitly marked as they can be phonemic, but generally they occur in the same or similar positions to their short counterparts. Most commonly a long vowel is used in stress syllables where adjacent vowels have been lost, or to indicate a greater quantity of an uncountable (air noun). The consonant inventory is /b, t, d, ʑ, k, g, β, ʂ, cʎ̥˔, ɰ, x, m, n/. /ʑ, β, ʂ, cʎ̥˔, ɰ/ will be romanized as <z, v, s, cl, w>. The full romanized alphabet is thus <b, t, d, z, k, g, v, s, cl, w, x, m, n, i/iː, u/uː, a/aː>.

The vowel system operates like a vertical system, with the above being the main articulated sounds. However [i ~ e ~ ɨ], [ə ~ ɘ ~ ɜ ~ e̞], and [ɑ ~ ä ~ a ~ æ]. These are also technically allophonic with rounded equivalents, but ogres will rarely produce rounded vowels in practice.

/t, d, cl, n/ are pronounced either with the tongue pinched between the teeth or behind the teeth as is convenient. Though these are allophonic with alveolar pronunciations, native speakers tend not to produce these sounds.

In consonant clusters where a dental precedes an /s/ as in /tsi/ [s ~ θs], so the actual pronunciation is often /tθsi/. In other consonant clusters [t  ~ θt]/[d  ~ θd] (e.g. /naːxtwa/ will often be pronounced /naːxθtwa/). θ is entirely non-phonemic. 

/cl/ is made by passing air through one side of the mouth, and native speakers hold their cheeks loose which results in a secondary articulation from cheek vibration on stressed syllables. This cheek vibration is also used for enunciation if the speaker feels the need to more strongly differentiate a /cl/. Lack of vibration where it would be expected would be understood as a foreign accent. 

/x,w/, /k,g/, /m,n/ are all considered contrasting pairs of sounds. /t,d,cl/ are all considered to contrast one another. /v/ is sometimes seen as an extension of /b/, particularly on the ends of words.

The consonant pair /xw/ is understood as a distinct phoneme from /x/ and /w/ in classical ogrish. It has its own symbols in the oggro-goblin syllabary and subsequent Xwauda abugida, and while Xwauda often creates consonant clusters when compounding it is reluctant to place /x/ and /w/ together when they were not so in one of the root words, often deviating from normal patterns to avoid this. 

Syllable structure was CV in Old Xwauda, but through vowel dropping and more occasional consonant dropping/grouping of like vowels is now C(V)(V).

Grammar
Noun Gender and Form
Nouns have six genders: Person (xwu), Water (wu), Fire (zu), Earth (xu), Air (ta), and Shadow (nu). Nouns are case/plurality marked on the basis of their gender. Verbs conjugate to agree with nouns on the basis of gender, plurality, and genitive relationships. 

Person nouns fall at the top of the animacy hierarchy and are associated with nouns with the final syllables: /xwa, ka, ga, xwi, ki, gi, xwu, ku, gu, xw, k, g/, as well as all proper nouns.
Water nouns are for life seen as less animate than a person (mostly plants, animals, people who are unfamiliar to or disliked by the speaker) and are associated with the final syllables: /wa, va, sa, si, su, w, v, s (ba, b)/.
Fire nouns are for things ogres understand as fire-like including gods, emotions, and laws of nature, they are associated with the final syllables /xu, xi, mu, mi, za, zu, zi, x, m, z/.
Earth nouns describe inanimate objects and are associated with the final syllables /xa, ma, x, m/.
Air nouns describe uncountables and concepts, and are associated with all final syllables where the last consonant is one of /t, d, cl/. 
Shadow nouns describe lacks of things, concepts related to inversion or negation and are associated with final syllables /wu,wi,vu,vi, na,nu,ni,w,v,n/. 

Nouns may be expressed in other genders where their own gender’s domain does not address their role in a sentence. The most common swap is between person and water nouns on the basis of familiarity with the speaker (a pet might be changed to a person noun even though it’s an animal, while a water variant might be used to talk about an ogre the speaker doesn’t know personally or even an enemy), to the extent where knowing whether a noun falls technically between person and water is nearly irrelevant as the case it is used in almost always depends more on context.
Person Nouns
Person nouns are considered full people, and encompass anything the ogre considers as a ‘friend’. By convention this means the self, family, members of one’s community, pets (including plants), and other friends with whom the speaker is familiar and views in a broadly positive light. A few odd person nouns (e.g. mud /xwa/) are inanimate objects traditionally given person-like qualities. In polite speech this always extends to the person being spoken to. Person nouns are considered countable. 

Dictionary

zami: (n, g: water, irregular) hand
mzami: (n,g: water, irregular) a handful (implied of water unless otherwise specified) 
waxs: (n,g: water) Lake
wata: (n,g: air) Water in the collective sense as is usually understood in english. Less commonly used for ogres. 
nucl: (n,g:air) shadow 
nuna: (n,g:shadow) zero:
ki: (n,g:person) one
si: (n,g:water) two

Old Xwauda Dictionary
Morphemes
x/w: x and w are frequently contrasted with each other as opposites. xa/wa (earth and water), and xu/wu (fire and shadow) are frequently considered as major opposite forces.
xa: earth, basic element opposite of water, inanimate objects, rigid unchanging things
xu(older)/xu: fire, basic element opposite of shadow, associated with gods, natural forces, feelings
wa: water, basic element opposite of earth, life, understood as countable as water is usually expressed in terms of a container (e.g. you can have two /mzami/ or /waxs/). Water expressed as a collective gets made into an air noun.
wu(older)/nu: shadow, basic element opposite of fire, associated with negation and inversion, absences, reflections. 
xw: person, ogre, being of fire/shadow/water/earth, animate. This stems from animacy being understood in agency, which is understood as having the ability to choose between contrasting forces
ba: many, plural suffix
bba: greater plural suffix. /bbba/, /bbbba/ also work though you tend to stop at three.
va: shorthand for a much greater plural. This in turn has given water a weak symbolic relation to plurality. 

Future Evolution Notes
Through various sound changes over the millennia the future word for “Ogre” becomes “Auga” which is where humans get their variant.
