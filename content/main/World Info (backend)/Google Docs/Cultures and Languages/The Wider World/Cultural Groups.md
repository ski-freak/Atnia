### Old World
Old world culture stretches from Atnia to Mnem, to the islands off the coast. These were the lands inhabited by the ancient empire of the ogres and the culture of the various peoples here reflects this history. Most peoples in this area share a three ages model of history: The Age of Plenty when they wanted for nothing often involving a benevolent race of angels, elves, what have you. The Age of Famine where the elves vanish and the land becomes unlivable. And finally The Age of Civilization – following the famines many people grouped into kingdoms which now war with each other for the lands. Nomadic cultures in the region often understand these civilizations as hangers on from the age of famine and believe that when they finally fall an age of plenty will return. Whereas the civilizations see themselves as saviors from this capitulating natural world that randomly swings between bounty and destruction. Part of the reason that they destroy indigenous history and narrative is because they want a hazier view of natural history to prevail; one that seems terrifying and to change without cause or influence. That way the colonizer appears to be a beacon of order in a sea of chaos.

Old world cultures share a lot of cultural myths about the land as well. The Deer of Calamity is a common myth across cultures in this region, and practically all Orcs in this area as well as many humans venerate the hero Zoggir. _____Why deer for calamity? We talked a bit about the images of deer of prosperity and calamity. This is part of the central tension between small petty kingdoms and the tribes of the forest in this land. Kingdoms must slay a symbol of the forest for their power but it also often comes back to bite them in the ass and they crumble. Civilization is always battling the wild tribes in these lands and up until the archmages civilization never really conquers the wilds, just beats it back in a limited area. Maybe something to do with the eco disaster after all the wolves are hunted? Sure this seems good. Floodplains expanding and such because the plants that held the river have all been eaten?

Ogres in this region follow the old ways and can almost universally trace their lineage back to the old empire (we’ll get to this later but not all ogres took part in it). Ogres in the region have a radically different culture of their own, less impacted by that of the other species. They often take on the role of monsters for the other species here, killing and attacking them for reasons beyond their understanding. 

The far west coast was largely uninhabited before the age of famine, but famines drove people from this region out in all directions, as it was the most affected by the ecosystem collapse. 

The city of Mnem in the far west was founded during the famine and while it was originally an old world culture spent many years isolated from other old world tribes, interacting more with traders from the Hellan and Old World Isles, making it somewhat of a cultural outlier.

### Old World Islander
The old world islands were primarily occupied by goblins and orcs before the age of famine, when more humans came in search of plenty and refuge. Notably the ecosystem collapse had relatively little impact on the oceans, and fishing remained a viable source of food. The orcs and goblins of the isles interacted heavily with the empire of the ogres but were much less affected by the age of famine. Myths of Zoggir spread from the mainland but never took hold here with the same fervor. 

Sometimes called the ‘endless isles’ 

The Old World Islands share a lot of culture in common with The Old World cultures, but place less stress on the eras of the world, have different myths around their local ecosystem and wildlife (with a lot more around ocean worship), and are much more strongly colored by goblin culture (norms on the mainland are much more driven by humans and orcs). 

Because of their focus on sailing, Old World Islanders are also more exposed to a variety of cultures from around the world, incorporating elements of them. Long, long ago, before the ogre empire, Hellas and The Old World isles were first discovered and settled by the same group of orcs and goblins. Though this history is not widely known and the two sets of islands have diverged significantly they have maintained regular contact and trade across the generations.

Few ogres live here. 

These islands were never settled in the time of the archmages. Hellas and Mnem’s militaries often occupied these isles with neither wanting to be the first to push the situation to violence. There are probably some skirmishes, proxy wars, and indigenous rebellions against colonial occupation here. Confused. ___________How is there occupation if they were never settled? – cold war between Hellas and Mnem, sometimes they suffer from it othertimes they profit off of it. Tension/powder keg. How was there not a who le lot of war if they were not settled? There are smaller skirmishes but usually not full blown war. That's always how it goes.

### Northerner
The north has always had very little to live on, and yet people still lived here since the beginning. Some migrated south during the time of plenty, but many remained, living off the land as best they could. Ogres, orcs, goblins, and humans often operate together in highly mixed communities here, exploiting their various talents to survive in the harsh environment. There was never a time of plenty, but those who survived in these lands also saw little difference during the time of famine. Northern Ogres can be hostile to and scoff at the superiority of Old World Ogres. 

Ogres are often solitary only rarely meeting up with other ogres and living as lone ogres in tribes of the other species for most of the year. Possibly the origin of ogres where many of them placed themselves in glaciers and were carried south during a great freeze near the dawn of time.

In the old days species fought dragons every winter but rarely kill them unless needed. Maybe by the time of the archmages dragons are in hiding even in the north, though probably more common there still. 

The northern “barbarians” have their territory significantly encroached on by Cyrvo’s theocracy and have a series of short lived alliances to wage war with the civilizers from the south all the way up until the apocalypse. 

### Pilgrim
After the time of famine during the time of early human empires a group of human religious extremists from various countries and nations who believed that all religions and pantheons were all part of an ancient true religion fled political persecution north to their theoretical holy land. These pilgrims would initially create The Veriglas, Cyrvo’s church. For many years it is a bitter struggle for survival as the northern tribes native to the region hate them, but they have the finances to hire mercenaries and slowly carve out a patch of land for themselves, that expands greatly into the north after the beginning of archmage rule.

### Hellan
Like the Old World Isles, the Hellan Isles were primarily occupied by seafaring orcs and goblins until the time of famine, when orcs and humans from the mainland came wandering in search of somewhere they could survive. Hellas differs geographically in that there were far more isles to settle, so there was less initial mingling between the immigrants and those who already lived there, leading to a highly fractured variety of cultures different from island to island. Trade still occurs, so while the cultures in the Hellan isles are highly divergent there is still a sort of meta culture across them, and norms between their interactions with one another.

Hellan immigrants also maintained some contact with the mainland, and readily began creating their own countries during the age of civilization. Much of Hellas ends up being dominated by “civilized” human culture, differing in this regard from the Old World Isles. However, the culture of the seafaring indigenous goblins and orcs remains much closer to that of The Old World Isles.

### Eastern and East Islander
Don’t know a ton about what’s going on here, just that the indigenous cultures south of the freezing lands to the north and east of the gorge should be distinct from those around them based on these geographic differences. 

### Lekvia
The indigenous peoples here are of whatever culture exists in the east, but a small kingdom founded by noble human exiles from a kingdom in the Old World persists just across the gorge. In some ways these Lekvians adopt indigenous eastern culture, but they are largely hostile to it, ‘civilizing’ what they can of the territory around them. Because they were hated and seen as political threats by their nearest ‘civilized’ neighbors across the gorge, Lekvians form a close relationship with Hellan kingdoms, taking aspects of their culture as well as from the east, becoming their own culturally distinct group. Lekvia prospered to a greater degree than most old world kingdoms, which rose and fell, eventually the kingdom that spawned Lekvia was lost to history while it remained. 

### East and West Jespark
Jespark covers a massive chunk of territory (maybe not properly expressed on the map I chose) and has a deep gradient of cultures across. Much of Jespark is covered by a vast desert, and while the population of this region is still quite large there are vast unpopulated lightly populated regions. Jespark suffered some of the worst of both worlds, benefitting little from the time of plenty and suffering greatly in the time of famine (maybe this is when the desert is formed?). 

I think this may actually be where Zoggir is from, so the myths here strongly reflect that. Kingdoms rarely stick here during the time of famine and many of the peoples here have stories of when their tribe was nearly brought to total extinction during the time of famine. The people who remained have developed strong identities around their smaller cultures. 

Pre-archmages, nobles from Lekvia found another dynasty here. While in theory they rule a large swath of land, in practice they have very little control over their diverse constituents and for most of their history a lot of their nation is within their borders in name only. I think maybe Lutekai’s father and grandfather do a bit to subjugate a lot of historically independent peoples and war with the peninsula to the west. Not sure what all happens under Lutekai. 

### Peninsular
Again still know little about this, just that there should probably be further indigenous cultures beyond the reach of Jespark.
