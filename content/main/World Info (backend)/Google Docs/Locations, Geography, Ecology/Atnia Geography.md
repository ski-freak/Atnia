The outer rings are the outer anchors of power designed to draw energy to Atnia from the outside world. Right before the fall of Atnia Ogres took Skyhaven. The Order of the Second in Atnia was always based in The Twilight Isle, and they seized control during the apocalypse. The Old Watch and The Stronghold of the Arbiters both still stand, though the purpose of the former remains in flux. Pax Nova is built at a shrine, left unassuming at the edge of the mountain. The Scorched Plain is where the Fifth Legion made their last stand, where they were protected from countless foes by a magical flame in their darkest hour. 

Liev is usually said to be the first city in Atnia, built long before the coming of The Archmages. Inhabited by a line of Lekvian nobles and officially a part of Lekvia, like many such colonies no real support was offered after the land was granted, and the nobles were struggling to pacify any amount of their “dominion”. 

The history of Atnia is unfolding before my eyes. Long ago, it was the seat of the great ogre empire. In the age of men, no one entered the glades around Aton save Ogres and Ogre-friends. For the Ogre’s magic was at its height, and they did not wish to be found. The signs of a great devastation were growing too dire to ignore, and were absorbed wholly in planning their contingencies to protect what they could. 

During the early years, the first “king and queen” of mortals were the agents sent by the ogres to manage the land and keep the peace between the other species. But these envoys slowed as the Ogre’s attention turned further and further inward. Among some mortals was born the idea of the divine right of kings – in those days ordained by a lineage of someone chosen by the ogres as an ally or friend. At first there was one undisputed lineage, then there were two. The grew deeper and deeper. By the time The Horned Legion marched from Atnia to clear these upstart kingdoms from lands vital to the healing of the environment the petty monarchies scattered across the old world went into freefall. Even those that were not invaded directly had to deal with predictions of the end times, and a loss of faith in their rule. Peasants rebelled, and those that could read and write depicted the era as a dark age for civilization. The land provided still for anyone who knew how to ask and to trade with it, but many in the kingdoms had forgotten how, and starved.

Some of those that knew how to write in that time, 

Aton is for a long time treated as the fated throne at the heart of the true empire. Not long after the march of The Horned Legion, The Twilight Isle becomes devotees of The Order of the Second.
