 Old watch magic:

Dream totems:
A dream totem is a piece of pure art on the outside (the facade), and an intricate machine on the inside (the heart). It is a machine built to 1) Erase itself perfectly. Only the outside facade and very inner core remain 2) Reconstitute its parts perfectly in both the material plane and the dream world given enough energy. 3) Create and detect minor tremors in the void and as the dream and physical world expand and contract. 4) Create and contain energy from passing matter back and forth between the two planes. Travelers are able to use these to travel from the material plane to the dream realm. The inner mechanisms are meant to self immolate in both worlds sending ripples in their specific signature through the void where the data can be picked up and coded into matter in the dream realm where matter naturally forms around thought, or in the material plane using the burst of energy when the void is snapped out of its place here, and the heart codes that energy back into you. The heart is superdense matter coded in your exact blueprint. The code is almost finished and It wants to finish itself and snap into place, but a singular bit of void prevents it. When your dream self is destroyed, the void expands out to fill its place in the dream and for a moment, and only a moment shrinks away in the exact place where it was trying to decode the rest of you. This moment is used to kick the dream out of the material plane and use the energy produced and contained from the departure to reconstitute your physical self. The condensed heart made of dream and flesh is what keeps your body anchored while you are in the dream realm. When your spiritual presence returns to the material plane and your body is reconstituted, the dream essence of your heart departs for the dream to once again become your anchor. The heart builds what is necessary in the dream realm to receive your form there and reconstitute you, and then travels across the void to occupy the center of the totem before you immolate yourself.



So I will talk later about the implications of a dream totem moving. What would happen if someone was able to infiltrate an empty dream totem and fill it with matter. Would it create a copy of the dreamer, and also prevent them from traveling back to the material plane? Would it just keep eating the matter forever? Also what if you were able to create a tiny sustainable hole in the outerwall that didn’t cause the whole thing to blow? Does void subtract until it eliminates itself? Is it only a reducing force in the universe? Does it have form outside of manifestations like ice and fire?

How can matter and dream travel back and forth between the two planes?

That’s not the sort we’re building when we are fermenting a thought however. We reverse engineer empty dream totems waiting to be filled, stealing “random” parts from the dream world. I say random, but we can at least influence the results. This is why we can’t think about an idea while it is “fermenting”. We are building up and shaping the negative space in our minds until we have created both its facade and its heart. Perhaps this is how fire was discovered by mortals.


Totem magic is possible, but as of yet that only includes things that came from the material plane traveling to dream and back. How does something from dream travel to the material plane in its totality? A dream can make the trip, be stripped of most of its essence, and then arrive in our plane as a ghost or an idea that has little power but to observe. It could feed on what little dream material lives in the material plane these days and slowly reconstitute itself that way, or it could consume the material plane directly, without refining it into pure dream first. This second type of food is much more abundant, but riddled with void and ultimately ties the dream to this world and death. This is how most mortal life forms are created. An idea which commits itself to a cell that will split and become infinite and its faculties, but ultimately die.


Dream primarily (entirely?) exists here through life. Ghosts usually manifest through the latent thoughts of mortals around them. If other dream sources are present they will attempt to leech off of those as well. One should note that life grows and thrives of its own accord in pretty much every environment given long enough time. Where there is life, and death there is magic. A jungle is a perfect example. The soil is all hard and clay like because there are so many roots feeding from it that stretch so deep. All of the plants provide food, shelter and medicine to those around and so more and more come. Life grows so thick here you need a machete just to walk. The soil is so hard that the plants must be burned, and the ashes laid to soften it, but the jungle remains greedy and will take back anything which is not managed with root and bramble. All of this growth and consumption breeds lots of magic. It gives wandering dreams many places to find purchase and power.

A life is a dream that comes to our world to be born and then die. Dreams only exist when there is an abundance of life, living and dying which is what makes them up.


In the dream realm matter naturally forms around thought, but thought rarely comes directly from the dream realm itself. Dream naturally forms around matter in the material plane, but almost never comes from this realm directly. Gods and Dragons may be an exception in both worlds.

What exactly happens when a god is consumed by a people?

They bend matter in this world. They create thought in the next. They exist in both.



A debt owed. Is it physical or psychological? 

Did the ogres consume the dragon's spirit as well as its form? I suppose for a time they did, but as they came back to Aton to lay themselves to rest, the spirit began to regrow, but now with the memories of those who had eaten it. What happens as the original Atnian ogres have children, or die in another land before being able to return? The soil might not take them, but fire or water could. Also is it the soil which refuses to take them, or they who refuse to give themselves back to the soil? They know that if they do, their power would seep back into the land, but with no guardian this time and so be easily consumed.


Ogres eat the forest dragon, and goblins are able to convince Zog to convince the earth dragon to end its own life. If the winter dragon falls we everything will probably enter an age of chaos before ultimately being consumed by the void. Killing the ocean dragon is damn near impossible. Killing the void dragon is impossible.

Just as cold and ice is life's response to the void, fire and heat is the void's response to life. It immolates life or at least keeps it moving. Fire is a mindless life that wants nothing more than to consume everything and then disappear. It has gained titles and spirits over the centuries such as muse, lifegiver and hearth.

So let's say that Atnia, the place where the original forest dragon was consumed, is a massive dream totem at the time of the apocalypse. It didn’t start off that way. Ogres settled the world before they began to notice a murmur in the earth's heartbeat, and that’s all it was; a murmur. Not all heard the call or headed or even knew what it was if they did. What they had observed was that not everyone's primary concern was the stewardship of the land. They saw then why the forest dragon had guarded its power so closely. Atnian ogres and descendants returned to Atnia to give themselves back to the forest dragon. First they gave themselves willingly to it and the land, but eventually the land was conquered and the magic stolen so they began burying themselves, sealing themselves up for the centuries as seeds, storing their knowledge and memories in the dream world. What remained of the dragon was a small, dumb fetus thing that, like any dragon, could not help but live in both worlds at once and so remained vulnerable. Many Ogres remained to guard this fledgling forest spirit while others returned to their dream to hide their own power and deliberate until there were enough of them to return the full might to the forest dragon. The ogres that returned in this way became living dream totems. Such a mass of dream totems hidden at the bottom of a sprawling citadel with an extensive tunnel system gave the void a significant foothold in this realm. Especially as more and more came to find their endings there as well. This is generally not great leading to ghosts and terrible deals with the void leading people and even entire settlements to disappear to it. It also took advantage of the Ogres subconscious will that man made structures should never reach the heights of the natural world by causing the man made structures to perpetually sink whenever built upon so that they’d never breach the mountain's peak. While this did unintentionally give the void another foothold in our world, it also ended up serving the ogres in giving them endless miles of tunnels to hide themselves in. Eventually all of the original Atnian Ogres and their direct descendants that are left link up in the dream realm. Ironically this includes those burned and drowned in the crusades, but not those consumed or replanted in foreign soil. The Ogres fear that even all of their combined strength wouldn’t be enough to fully restore the forest dragon as so many had been lost. Their plan was to simply battle away society and protect it while it regrow if they  had the power. The first Archmage saw the power which had been consumed by Ogres now lay in society itself. It had been eaten, or replanted. It had spread everywhere, becoming inseparable from the mortal races. The only advantage of all this was that companies and nation states naturally hoarded and consolidated their power so as to let the emissaries of the void have direct control over their interests. The remains of what had been stolen could be funneled into them, and then through ceremony back into the earth. The act of giving them the Forest dragon, although controversial, is what would topple their empire for they could not hold the full might of her strength, the full bounds of her beauty.


I like the idea of there being three main anchors for the void into our world, each where a dragon has died. The Forest dragon, the Earth dragon, and the Winter dragon. Note, are there also three main dream hubs? Or are all dragons dream hubs?







An Ogre cannot be consumed in its dream totem state. In fact breaking the outer rock like shell will cause a void implosion, and simply leave the ogre without a tether back to the material plane. To be consumed an Ogre must be in its natural state, and they can feel nothing in the material plane while in a dream totem state if they so choose, so prompting them to exit it by force is essentially impossible. Only through forceful reason.  However if one hunts down the Ogre in the dream realm and destroys it, sending it back to the void, it will immediately reappear in its vessel if it has one. Dream totems are not meant to be malleable, though everyone is different. Ogre totems which know how to shape the land are a rare exception, though they change so slowly and are so strong that they’re more malleable in the way that tungsten is. They are able to manipulate subtle currents in water, or fractures in rock by slightly altering the void within their totems which naturally influences the surrounding void. Physically this ends up looking like statues set in place to ‘appear’ as though they’re pushing or pulling on the surrounding landscape. A dream totem able to move in real time could influence matter like a god. 



How does Pyrus take advantage of Aton? What does his perfect garden look like?


Ouroboros monsters feeding off famine. Like the snake they seek to feed themselves knowing they’re still dying.

A dotted circle meaning a similar thing to an ouroboros in goblin culture, symbolizing a death march and why you should always question the orders of those in front of you

How the Ogres of Aton think of elements:
The light is revealing but destructive. Darkness is stability, uncertainty. 
Think through how light is infinity and void and how darkness is light and void  

Does the order the archmages eat the dragon matter?
