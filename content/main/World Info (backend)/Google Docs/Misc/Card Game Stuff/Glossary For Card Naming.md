The Archmages
Figure they might be useful for naming spell’s. “Lutekai’s Fireball” and the like idk.

Pyrus: Law/math/language focused archmage, Chancellor of Works of Atnia, ruling the country behind the scenes for centuries (technically Atnia was a constitutional monarchy, but Pyrus held effective power since its inception). 

Human, arbiter, eminus primary, old world secondary

Oana: Archmage focused on history of magic and the ancient elves. Her magic is more focused around metamagic stuff, counterspells, spell reversal or alteration. Ruled Mnem in the east.

Human, old world primary, arca secondary

Sorvald: Alchemy/medicine/immortality focused archmage. Was the high physician of Lekvia in the west, like Pyrus directing his nation from the shadows behind its official monarchy.

Human, vampire, arca primary, material secondary

Nyka: Archmage focusing on planar travel, most of her magic does not work after the apocalypse. She never ruled a nation. Universe spoilers – there aren’t really other planes and they’re all technically part of the dream realm, planar shifting doesn’t work right in Atnia because it’s been transported partially into the dream realm as part of the apocalypse. She might also have some dream related spells that would still function correctly, and her planar travel stuff could still work in theory it’s just all thrown off kilter by already being in the dream realm.

Human, dream, zelor primary, arca secondary

Lutekai: Physics based magic, a lot of the flashy fireball/storm conjuring stuff. Lutekai also did a lot of technology invention/is responsible for the rare trains that exist in the world as well as helping to popularize the musket (which is still rare in Atnia). Ruled Jespark. 

Human, material primary, zelor secondary

Cyrvo: Was the head of The Veriglas which became a sort of ‘one true church’ around the world, was responsible for popularizing a specific brand of divine magic that revolved around swearing yourself to a god and letting them act through you. Divine magic mostly doesn’t work anymore/is done by draining power out of existing relics in the world. 

Human, paladin, knight, priest, cleric old world primary, zelor secondary

Augusta: Divination/scrying archmage. Was admiral of the great fleet that kept peace in the Hellas isles.

Human, 
The Gods
Maybe useful for naming relics/divine magic stuff.

Ozen: Sun god, sort of a Thor figure, god of kings and right rulership. Brash, righteous, standard paladin fare. According to The Veriglas was king of the gods.

Hwain: God of magic and the elves, sort of an Odin style figure/father of Ozen. Previous king of the gods when the elves ruled the world but has since left things to his son (according to The Veriglas). Hwain’s root is actually the Aulvan concept of ‘mud’, which is related to magic and life itself. Wasn’t really a good in old Ogrish writings but has since been interpreted as such.

Oln: God of the dead, law, and commerce in The Veriglas. 

Vosderon: God of the seas and calamity in The Veriglas.

Tta: Wife of Hwain, old elvish god of mirrors, connection, divination, and prophecy. (another ‘old elvish god’ that wasn’t originally a god, was at one point the Aulvan concept of connection between distant things and events).

Braeg: Veriglas god of the forge, invention, and hard work. 

Eustor: Veriglas god of travel, messengers, and the planes. Kind of a Hermes figure.

Mvos: Veriglas god of dream. 

Lug: For the Veriglas Lug is an angel representing the light within the darkness, a patron of heroes. Lug’s stories cast him as originally a mortal who ascended to godhood in childhood, but according to The Veriglas mortals cannot become gods so Lug is instead cast as an archangel under the direct service of Ozen. However Lug was actually a god for the ancient Aulva and is still worshiped in that capacity. The original meaning of Lug was actually “the fire within shadow, and shadow within fire”. He was originally a god of irony and the mixing of contradictory concepts. Often paladins who serve Lug today are brought into this moral murkiness by the true figure, who is one of the gods that is still around and heavily influential after the apocalypse (though he does not respond to requests for divine power from most, appearing dead like the other gods). 
Nations
Atnia: Main setting, lots of details on that.

Lekvia: To the east of Atnia, Sorvald has converted most of the life there into vampires as debatably the last living archmage. Was originally a sort of classic fantasy setting with a kingdom and hierarchical nobility.

Jespark: South of Atnia, a great chunk of the continent falls under Jespark’s rule. For a long time was seen as a bit of a backwater but with legitimate nobility, similar to Europe’s relationship to Russia through a lot of the middle ages. Under Lutekai, the last archmage to ascend, Jespark rapidly modernized into arguably the most technologically advanced of the archmage ruled nations.

Mnem: Originally settled by nobles of the first empire fleeing from The Horned Legion, the nobles of Mnem can still trace their lineage back to this first nobility, and argues that they hold the most rightful claim to world rulership. Mnem was the first nation to fall just before the more total apocalypse, with the Ogres who Oana was experimenting on revolting and taking control to begin their attempt to unseat the other archmages. However their action came too late…

Hellas: A collection of islands operating under different governments to the southeast of Atnia. For a long time these states warred a lot despite having a broadly shared cultural group (think ancient Greece), but Augusta and her fleet of mercenaries ultimately pacified pirate activity on the islands and up until the apocalypse served as a sort of international police force there providing unity and preventing wars. 
Within Atnia
The Old Watch: Peasant democracy that overthrew its nobles on the night of the apocalypse. For a while attempted to work with those nobles for a shared government but after being screwed over one too many times the peasants eventually exiled them. Practically worships the walls that saved them from the monsters. Strict code of laws around labor and public votes for basically everything from criminal trials to how harvests should be distributed.

In addition to the main old watch there are several allied factions. The Inkbloods are mages in a nearby tower that The Old Watch reluctantly does business with. The Inkbloods are actually subject to one of Pyrus’s attempts at immortality, encoding his mind into books and ink and trying to convert these mages into clones of himself through slow erosion of their minds and promises of power. The Scouts are an allied faction of rangers and druids made up partly of exiled nobles and partly of indigenous bands that had been slowly pushed out into the mountains during Pyrus’s rule of Atnia. The Wall Knights are the only nobles accepted fully in Old Watch society, though they are not allowed to vote. During the revolution the knights defending The Watch chose to defend the wall from the onslaught of monsters rather than turning inward to heed the noble’s cries for aid, so the democracy forever venerates them and allows them to keep their noble titles so long as they swear an oath of disinterest in village politics.

The Knights of Redemption: In Pax Nova to the far north of Atnia lies a great city on a lake housing a society built around heroes. After the apocalypse the three heroes Saint Eudoxia, Esmond Pater the wizard, and Gakt the orc barbarian saved who they could and brought them to this safe haven. The Knights of Redemption bill themselves as the true successor government to Atnia, with Eudoxia as the current queen. They have about a billion knightly orders, check their doc in the ‘cultures and languages’ folder for the stuff that’s set in stone/the major stuff but also feel free to make stuff up (they currently have the best/most comprehensive up to date doc). 

The Fifth Legion: Also known as The Coward’s Legion, the fifth legion fled during the apocalypse and spent a good amount of time raiding small villages for their own survival. They have since reorganized and are less of a roving band of bandits, but still carry with them a lot of that legacy as well as the basic military structure of Atnia. Also claims to be a successor state to Atnia. 

The Forsaken: Kind of anarchic faction of dream mages that argues if the gods are dead that’s a good thing and that actually gives us freedom to build a better society. They protect various villages and do a lot with teleport/fast traveling through dream. They dress super weird and vibrantly to be able to uniquely recognize one another in dream by a variety of specific constants they keep. Range from super rad anarchists to nutso cultists trying to birth new gods. 

The Salt Alliance: Before the apocalypse many of the indigenous cultures in Atnia were progressively pushed into the mountains and formed an alliance for survival that ended up also encompassing bandits and other such societal outcasts. Without the military hunting them down they’re actually doing better after the apocalypse than they were before. Some of the most species/cultural diversity of any faction. They don’t necessarily have a specific aim as a whole but some sub factions do and can even be diametrically opposed. The Ogres of Mnem are ogres from outside seeking to keep Atnia quarantined and keep anyone from claiming the power of the rift in the sky until they can figure out what to do with it. Conversely The Order of The Second is a secret society of mostly goblins but open to all species that seeks to bring about great rulers so they can operate in the shadows behind the scenes and be the ones actually profiting off their power. Most members of the Salt Alliance are just trying to survive though and aren’t super aware of these two forces vying for control. 

The Pale Sun: A small society of worshippers of a new god, The Pale Sun, a white hot star deep beneath their mountain. This god is one of the few gods that is still very real and alive and can grant miracles, at the cost of sacrifices to its consuming flames, which defy conservation of matter and truly scorch away these offerings into the void. Semi-fascist and xenophobic faction, eventually all the moisture and color gets scorched from their mage’s skin and they slowly become more skeletal husks. 

The College of Dreams: The Nameless City was a city devoted to magic of the mind and planes in Atnia and it disappeared off the map during the apocalypse. Nyka helped to combine it with similar cities in the dream realm to help them avoid disaster. The college of dreams now flits between dream and various physical locations. They are currently occupied with battling nightmares. It’s possible for one’s dream self to be a member of the college and have a waking self that is unaware of it. The College often has clear aims but due to existing in the dream realm and operating on dream logic it sometimes ends up expressing these in very confusing goals or plans in the physical world that no longer make much sense, as most of its leadership spends most or all their time deep in dream.
