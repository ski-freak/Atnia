**1. Nightmares and Dreams

Many have dreamed of that woman, hunched and wrapped head to toe in brown fabric and shadow. Many have heard her words. Each dream similar and yet a universe unto itself.

  

“In the outer reaches of the Nightmare you might stumble upon the truth. Not the whole, or even the half of it. But the fragments may prove enlightening all the same. Take care, if you intend to seek such secrets. You must understand that for we humans curiosity is our very magic, and our curse. Before you dip into the waters to sate it, know what you seek and why you seek it lest you be consumed in the depths of that endless abyss.

  

“But you are unconvinced, are you not?”

  

“.”

  

“I have spoken this warning to many a student, yet most pay no heed. Questions are the mark of a healthy mind. I would not think to discourage even a single one. Yet, the great endlessness of Question itself is like a vast whirlpool. Even experienced sailors have been dragged into the eye. 

“How blessed would we be if there were only madness to fear? The mad yet live. But when Question takes root it leeches all other cares from the soil of the mind. There may be no other object for dreams, and the troubles of mortals seem far away. I cannot bring myself to call it evil. There is no selfishness, no malice. Just a terrible destructive apathy. The fault lies with the teacher, of course. Or perhaps it can’t be helped. 

  

“What but curiosity interests one in magic in the first place?”

  

“.”

  

“I do not wish you despair, in fact what I wish to say is that in the deepest of darkness there is hope. The worst horrors of the past, my failures, are an instrument of instruction which I have never before had at my disposal. The ruins of a shattered world very nearly speak for themselves. But I must restrain myself. There is nothing worse than a lecture for inciting intellectual rebellion, and you know far better than I that which you wish to know. 

  

“What did you wish to ask of me?”

  

“?”

  

“May the answer arrive on the back of a gentle dream.”

2. The Machinery of Nightmare

The dream shifts before your eyes, as if on command. The sun’s gold rays splay from the dazzling blue sky across the mottled greens and browns of a garden. The woman is nowhere to be seen.

  

A thunderous crash from the far side of the garden, across the hedges. The old man shut the journal and put it into the inner pocket of his coat as he pushed himself up from the bench. Even with clockwork there will be imperfections. All things require maintenance. As he walked he produced a silver hand-mirror from an outer pocket and glanced at the bobbing distorted reflection of his rounded face framed by flowing ivory locks and beard. If something was out of sync in the garden, no doubt there were greater imperfections still that had yet escaped his notice.

The mirror was a gift from an old friend, or at least he preferred to think of it that way. Augusta had been a friend, and the mirror had been given freely. Through it he could see anything he wished within the boundaries of his tranquil kingdom. How useful it had been! He was touched just remembering her thoughtfulness. Surely it had been a gift. And not a threat.

He knew just where the sound had come from in the garden, having designed the acoustics himself. The garden encircled his palace just as his valley encircled the city. It was not difficult to determine the corollary location. His reflection disappeared from the mirror, it was now full of the deep gray flagstones that paved the city of Svet. Truth be told he had already been expecting trouble there. 

A crowd had gathered around the statue of Sorvald – the likeness of another old friend cast in bronze holding a lit candle aloft in one hand, the fountain’s water pouring from the chalice hanging from the other. Beneath the statue were the three figures he had resigned himself to seeing commanding the attention of the crowd. Dr. Pater, a wayward scholar of his own alma mater at Aton, had proved adept at keeping his rabble rousing wife within the boundaries of the law (to say nothing of their pet orc). Likely they were stirring up trouble over their recent expulsion from the city of Myrkur by Cerbus’s own archbishop. No laws had yet been broken by either party. Law was his domain, and he always knew of its breaking. There was nothing to do but to leave the drama to play itself out in the meanwhile. Troubling. 

Presently he came to the fountain. This he had made himself, knowing well his friend’s methods. One of the garden’s few asymmetries, this strange angular artifice of dark stone had no basin. Water spilled across its angles and folds into the ground, and it was from here that the whole garden was nourished. And it was broken. One of the many angular protrusions had shattered, leaving pieces of stone strewn about the clearing, the opening spilling water that had begun to pool on the earth below. But it flowed around something. A blue glow, a rift hanging in the air. He saw it for what it was: A fragment of a spell. The man’s heart sank. Someone had finally staked their bet.

He ran as though his body were untouched by the weight of years. In moments he was one seventh rotation south and west around the loop of the garden, where there hung another pale blue tear in open space. By correspondence if the fountain marked Svet then this would be the unnamed city. He needn’t take another step to confirm his fears. If he kept running he would find the same at the spot corresponding to each of the seven cities. And surely, he glanced at the great tower in the center of the garden, Pax would be soon to follow. 

He relaxed. There was nothing to be done. No laws or contracts had been breached. He, too, had staked his bet long ago. There would be a reckoning for this, and it would all fall in his favor in the end. He had spent enough sleepless nights planning contingencies. Now he could be calm. Nothing today was beyond his expectations. 

Who, he wondered, had betrayed him? He had never much liked Cerbus, but surely if it were him it would have been louder. Perhaps there was time left for that. Augusta, Sorvald? He hoped not. Lutekai’s temper had only intensified with age, he was not out of the question. Nyka would make as much sense, he had long suspected that she wanted them all dead. Perhaps she had influenced the dreams of the monsters that… no. Even she held too much respect for their teacher to stoop so low. If only Oana could see them now, squabbling like children. Surely she died thinking she had taught them better. That one of her power had succumbed to her own ogres still baffled him. 

He had a recurring nightmare that always started with her corpse, all hacked to pieces by the brutes she had seen fit to surround herself with. As her blood nourished the earth the shadow cast by her corpse seemed to extend beyond the horizon. If you looked at that shadow long enough you would see the eyes, thousands of eyes. Then the corpse’s blood began to run a fiery gold, its heat scorching and strangling the soil. Then all the earth would melt away, the brown-cloaked Goddess asserting Her authority over his very right to exist here. Only for his body to be rent apart by gravity itself, pulling in all directions.

Just like the dream, he would wake up from this reality after the horror had passed. How would it really feel? he wondered. Would he remember when he woke? The mirror slipped from his hand, shattering against the earth into a thousand shards reflecting every corner of Atnia. 

3. The Bulwark of Hope

A thousand worlds reflected in the shards of a mirror, once intertwined through bonds of nation and tradition. Now isolated by pain and fear they grow a universe apart.

  

Mahius Redl had been Knight Commander of Fost Féac for nearly a decade. He had long since resigned himself 

 was the last place in all of Atnia any knight wanted to be posted. Those seeking glory had better prospects at the inner forts where the pacification of the occasional band of orcs, goblins, or rebels would suffice for stories of heroism and valor. Not like the stories of old, but a warrior had to make do in the era of peace. 

Féac was positioned in the mountains overlooking the southern pass into Atnia, a relic of bygone years when an invasion on foot through one of the passes or the east bridge was a serious subject of concern among the generals. Now, the web of treaties constructed by Chancellor Pyrus with the other archmages as well as advances in magical transportation rendered an invasion on foot an act of strategic lunacy. This alone would not have made it such an unpopular post, of course. Not all knights dream of blood, and indeed some relished the 

dquiet contemplation afforded by other such obsolete bastions. The view of the morning mist rising over the mountains from atop the wall was on some days sufficient to distract from 

The fortress predated unification, and while it had since been refurbished several times the simplistic practical stonework at its foundations gave it a rustic character seldom seen nearly a century and a half since the great architectural upheaval ordered by the Chancellor. The nobles of the gold would gawk for long hours at the outer walls and the architecture of the palace. Informally, the soldiers and the bronze called it “The Old Watch.” Still further from the ears of the high nobles the more bitter among the knights called it “The Crib”. The servants who made up the nobles’ entourages spoke of it in more fearful terms.

A quirk of history placed this fortress outside of Atnia’s official domain. After Atnian unification there were few regions where Chancellor Pyrus needed to negotiate the boundaries of his domain with his colleagues. The ring of mountains – both real and artificial – and the great chasm in the east left little room for doubt. However, Lutekai of Jesparch to the south had among the vast legions of his empire recruited a nomadic tribe that had followed a particular yearly migration for generations. For two and a half moons each year, they would hunt and live off the land in the mountains near the pass before descending back south. Accepting no deal to preserve the rights of the particular tribe, Lutekai insisted that their allegiance made the pass a part of his territory. After long negotiations, they agreed that the territory would be neither of theirs, but that its historic uses by various people’s of both sides might be maintained. Thus the watchful eye of the Chancellor’s law did not reach The Old Watch.

This was the true reason nobles of the gold took an interest in the place. Traditionally, serious military outposts were manned by knighted members of the silver caste. Knights among the gold rarely concerned themselves with such small military matters, instead honing themselves for heroic quests or the commanding of armies. But there seemed to be an endless supply of reasons the defunct Fost Féac needed inspection and reinforcement. Knight Commander Redel had little choice but to smile, turn over the superior chambers in the palace, and assure that the needs of his betters were attended to. The chief aspect of his vocation during these months was fetching wine from the cellars. The personal degradation was among the least onerous aspects of their visits for the commander. He would even assent, eagerly, to be their jester and the subject of their mockery whenever it seemed likely to distract them from their other pastimes. Pastimes from which his station kept him physically safe, yet the memories scarred him all the same.

During the months the keep was populated only by its regular staff, the Knight Commander would joke over a drink with his most trusted subordinates that one day the nobles might find themselves on the other end of the lawlessness of the old keep. Even among his closest friends the remark would be met with nervous laughter at best, and more frequently silence. He supposed it helped them get through the days to pretend there was a future for their careers after being assigned here. And while all knew the rumors of the sadistic sport that occurred in the palace, none save Redel had to play host. Of course they wouldn’t really understand.
