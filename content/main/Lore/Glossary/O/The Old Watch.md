The Old Watch is a small keep in the mountains of southern Atnia, surrounded by layers of walls. During the apocalypse the peasants of The Watch revolted. Now the keep is ruled by a legalistic peasant democracy, with harsh laws to punish those who steal or hoard resources that could be used for survival. Superstitious and mistrustful of magic, practicing magic or even wearing the clothing of nobility is grounds for revocation of citizenship in The Watch. In the outer walls and further beyond in Tower Inkblood, an ecosystem of exiles and allied foreigners and mages maintains a tense symbiotic relationship with the peasants of the inner wall.
