The University is a prestigious and ancient place of scholarship on the Isle of Adva in northern Hellas. Already a prestigious place of scholarship, but after five disciples from this school successfully explored the depths of the ruins at Aton and became the most powerful mages the world had ever known, it quickly rose to prominence as the premier institution of scholarship and magic in the entire world.
