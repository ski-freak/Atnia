The Salt Alliance was a ragtag band of guerilla fighters, criminals, and natives of Atnia prior to colonization. They were the most equipped to survive the apocalypse, and have expanded greatly and have many cities and outposts in the secluded places of the world. The Salt Alliance embodies a wealth of cultures from Atnia and surrounding regions, including ogres from both near and afar, indigenous humans and orcs, and a large population of goblins.
