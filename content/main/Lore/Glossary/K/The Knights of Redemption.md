The Knights of Redemption hold the truest claim as the successor state of Atnia. The city of Pax Nova rests on a lake in the north, defended by several glorious orders of knights and protected by the hero-queen Eudoxia â€“ a minor relative of the king and paladin of the god Lug who alongside her companions saved who she could when the world ended. Now that the gods cannot be contacted and their power only drawn from their remaining relics in the world, The Knights of Redemption have adapted to support their limited divine power with arcane power and martial skill. While prior to the apocalypse orcs were second class citizens, they always have a home in Pax Nova due to the heroism of the hero Gakt, and The Order of The Torch follows in his footsteps to this day.
