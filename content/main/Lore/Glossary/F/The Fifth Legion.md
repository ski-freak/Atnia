The Fifth Legion, sometimes known as the ‘coward’s legion’, is the one surviving fixture of Atnia’s military. Rather than standing in reserve when the apocalypse happened, the commander of The Fifth Legion ordered a retreat, abandoning the other legions for their own survival. Now lacking in a coherent identity and roaming the lands in search of food the legion stands at the crux between a group of bandits, an organized military, and a society of nomads.
