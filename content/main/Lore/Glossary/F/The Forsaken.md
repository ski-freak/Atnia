The Forsaken believe that the gods died with the apocalypse, or have abandoned the world, but that this is a good thing. Freed from the chains of the gods and the old civilizations the mortal races finally have a chance to build something truly new. What that ‘new’ is is a point of much disagreement, and The Forsaken tolerate it all as a faction, using dream magic and the tears between the waking world and the land of dreams to ensure their own survival and to help those they choose to protect.
