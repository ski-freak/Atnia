The original form of alchemy invented by the [[Archmages|archmage]] [[Sorvald]], a type of magic combined with the fields of medicine and chemistry to allow the creation of magical tinctures and [[Invention Magic|inventions]], often rooted in the manipulation of substances on the molecular level.  ^434027
## Major Alchemy

Building on the work of his teacher Sorvald, [[Lutekai]] joined the ranks of the archmages when he invented his own school of magic. Major alchemy still focuses on manipulating substances at the molecular level, but uses this manipulation to produce a chain reaction with dramatic results such as a fireball or a powerful wind. Of all the known types of magic, major alchemy is generally the most flashy and visible, though it can also be used to produce magical wonders.
