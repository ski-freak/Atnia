The prevalence of [[Magic|magic]] has waxed and waned in the world throughout the [[The Ages of the World|eras]], but all can agree that it reached its zenith in [[The Ages of the World#^668380|the age of the archmages]], at least since the time of [[The Aulva]]. Five scholars from [[The University of Adva]] delved into the ruins at [[Aton]], to return with great magical secrets that would revolutionize the world. [[Pyrus]], [[Nyka]], [[Augusta]], and [[Sorvald]] were students of the college at the time, and the expedition was led by their mentor [[Oana]]. Shortly after their discovery they were joined by the [[The Veriglas|Veriglas]] priest [[Cyrvo]] who adapted their findings to create a direct covenant with [[The Gods]]. Many years later [[Lutekai]], a student of Sorvald, would invent [[Alchemy#^7bb4e8|Major Alchemy]] and become widely considered as the seventh archmage. Whispers also speak of a mysterious [[The First Archmage|First Archmage]] said to have come before the others, though most believe this shadowy figure to be merely an urban legend.
