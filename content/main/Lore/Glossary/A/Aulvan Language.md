The ancient language carved into the stone walls of the [[Aulvan Ruins|ruins]] of [[The Aulva]]. Countless scholars have devoted their lives to studying it and unlocking its mysteries, including the [[Archmages|archmages]] [[main/Lore/Glossary/O/Oana|Oana]] and [[Pyrus]]. All modern languages are said to share a common ancestor in the language of the Aulva, with [[Atonian]] being thought to be its nearest successor.
