*[[Hwain]]'s Last Stand - The Return of [[The Horned Legion]] - [[The Ages of the World#^668380|Modern]]ity's Due*

And yet there was hope, too, for how could [[The Gods]] lose to this army of darkness. Yet lose they did, or so it appeared, for the army of light disappeared from the sky and the dark horned soldiers above the clouds shouted cheers of triumph before descending upon the earth.
