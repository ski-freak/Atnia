The paradise of the [[Elves|elves]] that [[Hwain]] visited upon the world in [[The Ages of the World#^e99cf4|The Third Age]] according to [[The Veriglas]]. With the scatterings of peoples, The Veriglas believes we have strayed from this paradise, but in recognizing our brother and sisterhood all as children of [[The Gods]] before the petty divisions of nations we might one day achieve it again.
