## The First Age

*The Age of First Breath - The Paradise of Hwain - The First Sunrise - The Age of the Deep Sea - The Great Winter*

Little is said of this age outside of myth, but most cultures around the world have legends of an era before a habitable world. A time of great forces that would come to shape the world to be, towering titans that would create great pockets of life and send them crashing back down into the abyss or the waves.

According to [[The Veriglas]], first there was [[Hwain]], god of [[Magic|magic]], who in this era crafted the other gods. While many cultures depict this time as chaotic and destructive, to The Veriglas this era was the first paradise under the perfect order imagined by Hwain.
## The Second Age

*The Age of Ancients - The Age of Dragons - The Primordial Spring*

Still spoken of mostly in myth, stories now begin to include mortals alongside [[The Gods|Gods]]. Pantheons often speak of the children of the first gods during this time. [[True Dragons|Dragons]] and titans still dominate much of the earth and mortals live in fear of great forces beyond their control. Towards the end of the second age though mortals begin acquiring more agency over their world.

The Veriglas speaks of this era as the early strife within the pantheon of the gods, as Hwainâ€™s children begin to undermine his rightful leadership. The era is commonly understood to end with the rise of the Aulva, the first mortals to gain true agency in the world.

*The Age of the Aulva - The Age of the Elves - The Age of Enlightenment*

The Aulva, an ancient mysterious civilization commonly thought to be the first mortal empire, take charge of the great continent and beyond. The Aulva are often thought to by a hypothetical extinct race more commonly referred to as 'elves'. According to The Veriglas, The first Elves were angels or demigods sent down by the god Hwain himself to reshape the world in the perfect image of the heavens. This era was thought to be full of magic, for it was presided over by the god of magic Hwain and his chosen people. Aton is commonly thought to have been the first city, out from which the great Aulvan empire greatly expanded. This era is still strongly associated with dragons, with this civilization at times being cast in legend as a great nation of dragon slayers, at other times as dragon friends. It is a common belief that the elves ruled over the other species of this time, taking care of them and inviting them into their paradise. Rarely are the Aulva spoken of as tyrannical, though such stories exist as well.

## The Fourth Age

*The Age of Kings - The Age of Nobility - The Age of War*

After what seemed like an eternity of paradise, the Aulva began to disappear from the world, retreating to their hidden groves and caves. The other mortals were left more and more to their own devices in the paradise the Aulva built. According to The Veriglas the first human kings were anointed by the elves themselves, and for a while the paradise was maintained. But after a time disagreements and splits began. For much of the fourth age the great unifying civilization of the Aulva was split into the twin empires of Cornagt and Xwageen,
