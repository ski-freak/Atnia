## The First Age

*The Age of First Breath - The Paradise of Hwain - The First Sunrise - The Age of the Deep Sea - The Great Winter*

Little is said of this age outside of myth, but most cultures around the world have legends of an era before a habitable earth. A time of great forces that would come to shape the world to be, towering titans that would create great pockets of life and send them crashing back down into the abyss or the waves.

According to the Veriglas, first there was Hwain, god of magic, who in this era crafted the other gods. While many cultures depict this time as chaotic and destructive, to The Veriglas this era was the first paradise under the perfect order imagined by Hwain.
## The Second Age

Still spoken of mostly in myth, stories now begin to include mortals alongside gods. Pantheons often speak of the children of the first gods during this time. Dragons and titans still dominate much of the earth and mortals live in fear of great forces beyond their control. Towards the end of the second age though mortals begin acquiring more agency over their world.

The Veriglas speaks of this era as the early strife within the pantheon of the gods, as Hwainâ€™s children begin to undermine his rightful leadership. The era is commonly understood to end with the rise of the Aulva, the first mortals to gain true agency in the world.
