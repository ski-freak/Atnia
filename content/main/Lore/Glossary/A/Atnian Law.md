[[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]] is known as the home of the most advanced legal system in the world, utilizing the [[Law Magic]] designed by [[Chancellor of Works|Chancellor]] [[Pyrus]] and enforced practically by [[The Arbiters]]. It balances universal equality under the law with due privileges granted to the heroic [[Atnian Nobility|nobility]]. Atnian law is normally written in [[True]], a pure logical language designed by chancellor Pyrus to avoid ambiguity or contradiction. Atnia's magical structure allows magical decrees to be easily enforced across the nation from the seat of power at [[Pax]].
