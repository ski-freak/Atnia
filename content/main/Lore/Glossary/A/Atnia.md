Atnia refers to the great valley around the ruins of [[Aton]] which held the seat of the great [[The Aulva|Aulvan]] empire many thousands of years ago. For many years it was a mere hypothetical kingdom, often granted to troublesome but well regarded nobles in [[Jespark]] and elsewhere as a faux honor and practical exile. The land was considered untamable as colonial efforts were always beaten back by the [[Ogers]] and [[Indigenous Atnian Culture|'savage' tribes]] that inhabited those jungles. 

When the [[Archmages|archmages]] successfully explored the [[Aulvan Ruins|ruins]] at [[Aton]] they also paved the way for  [[The Bevan Dynasty]], which had been teetering on the edge of ruin, to fully colonize the land. The archmage [[Pyrus]] would remain there to aid in the construction efforts, eventually ascending via popular vote to the position of [[Chancellor of Works|High Chancellor of Works]] as part of Atnia's constitutional government under the monarchy -- a position he would maintain through repeated reelection for over a century.

Under the leadership of the Bevan royals and the advice of the wise archmage Pyrus, Atnia would develop the most advanced [[Atnian Law|legal system]] in the world, balancing the primacy of the [[Atnian Nobility|aristocracy]] with universal legal rights and the maintenance of order. It is said that before [[Hwain's Last Stand]] there was less crime in Atnia than any of the world's other nations. These laws were enforced by [[Law Magic|magically binding social contracts]] and an elite order of law [[Wizardry|mages]] known as [[The Arbiters]]. 

Though small, Atnia in many ways was seen as the model [[The Ages of the World#^a57220|modern]] nation. With almost all of its cities and roads built after the study of magic and following the most advanced mathemagical principals. Each of the six great satellite cities: [[Aton]], [[Liev]], [[The Nameless City]], [[Myrkur]], [[Svet]], and [[Oruva]] resting at equidistant points in a hexagon around the capital city of [[Pax]]. These cities were joined by an efficient symmetrical network of roads, with smaller peasant trade towns at each of the [[The Twelve Crossroads]] this network produced. In spite of its small army, Atnia was considered relatively safe from invaders due to the mountains and coastline protecting the vast majority of its borders, and the network of international treaties negotiated by Chancellor Pyrus that made a foreign invasion seem unthinkable.

In the generation following Hwain's Last Stand the scant survivors in Atnia have grown divided from one another and the outside world, hiding from the monsters that stalk the roads in their havens of safety. [[main/Lore/Glossary/O/The Old Watch|The Old Watch]] of the old fort [[Fost FÃ©ac]], [[main/Lore/Glossary/K/The Knights of Redemption|The Knights of Redemption]] at [[Pax Nova]], [[The Salt Alliance]] of [[Skyhaven]] and [[The Twilight Isle]], [[The Forsaken]] with their refuges in [[main/Lore/Glossary/D/Dream|Dream]], and [[The Fifth Legion]] of [[Lentholm]] and [[The Scorched Plain]] form the largest of these groups. Only now, eighty some years after the world fell apart, do they dare to venture far enough that they encounter each other in numbers.
