There are three main social castes in [[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]]: Gold, Silver, and [[Atnian Peasants|Bronze]], as well as special legal standings for unnaturalized "foreign guests" and "foreign aliens". The initial nobles of [[The Bevan Dynasty]] formed the first members of the gold cast, and while they may not inherit the throne all legitimate descendants of these nobles are considered members of The Gold. The Gold Caste may freely marry members of The Silver, and children born of such a marriage are considered legitimate descendants of The Gold. The Gold Cast is a birthright only, however, and one cannot marry into membership. Members of The Gold Caste are expected to be exemplary members of Atnian royalty, and speak and write publicly only in [[High Atonian]] or face shame. Privately, many members of The Gold Cast will use [[Middle Atonian]], though the most conservative among them will not. For any noble to be caught using [[Vulgar Atonian]] is a great shame.

The Silver Caste consists of all other nobles in Atnia -- mostly of individuals who performed great feats in service of Atnia (most frequently in [[The Arbiters]] or the military) and their descendants. Nobles of other nations who immigrate to Atnia and do not bear lineage from members of The Gold Caste are generally granted membership in The Silver. The Silver class may freely marry members of The Gold and The Bronze, though the latter is generally frowned upon, especially in more respected families. The child of a legitimate marriage between Silver and Bronze is granted membership in The Silver Caste, though if this is widely known they will often have to endure the slur "Silv√≠n" or "Half Noble" from peasant and noble alike. 

The Silver Caste generally made up most of the ranks of The Arbiters as well as the knighted elite of the Atnian military, the most well respected merchants and craftsman, and the majority of Atnia's scholars. 

Atnian Nobles of both the Gold and Silver caste had much the same privileges allowing them to hold major positions of leadership, though in general by tradition and convention many positions in the government and military were generally reserved for members of one caste or the other. Nobles were also allowed to travel freely without any papers other than their proof of station.
