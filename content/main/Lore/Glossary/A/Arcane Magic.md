This lay categorization of [[Magic|magic]] was common among the peasantry of [[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]] for many years, but grew in popularity after [[The Apocalypse]] -- a terrible cataclysm for which magic is commonly blamed. Most schools of [[Wizardry|wizardry]] are classified as 'arcane', or beyond the understanding of normal mortals. This classification has negative connotations, and arcane magic is generally viewed with suspicion or fear, though not so much as [[Profane Magic|profane magic]].
