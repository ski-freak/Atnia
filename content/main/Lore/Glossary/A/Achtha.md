God of hands and father of the four winds. Primarily worshipped among goblins. While the other sapient species were gifted hands by the winds, goblins believe they stole theirs from Actha while he slept in a drunken stupor.

*"Achta's hands shaped earth and sky,*
*but what's made by hands is doomed to die."* - Goblin proverb
