*"Aton Stands Where Dragons Fell
Where Stones Can Speak and Ogers Dwell"

Arguably the first city in [[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]], Aton is built on top of perhaps the oldest [[Aulvan Ruins|Aulvan Ruin]] in the world, where the [[Archmages|archmages]] discovered powerful magical secrets. The city naturally began to expand outwards from the ruins as explorers and scholars flocked from around the world, and trade and supplies were increasingly required. It remained a central cite of scholarship of [[The Aulva]] and in particular their [[Aulvan Language|language]]. As a necessarily fixed point in the circle of cities around Atnia, though it is located on an edge it became a naturally confining factor on where the other cities could be located to maintain Atnia's magical structure.
