Admiral Augusta's fleet of mercenaries is credited with driving [[Pirates|piracy]] out of [[The Hellas Isles]] and keeping the peace there during [[The Ages of the World#^668380|The Eighth Age]]. Unique among the [[Archmages|archmages]], Augusta was a soldier rather than a scholar, studying at [[The University of Adva]] to be a navigator and negotiator for her family's mercenary company. She led the soldiers that protected the archmages during their expedition, and her strategic genius is credited with their survival at the hands of the [[Ogers|ogers]] that descended on their expedition from the jungle. 

After the expedition, word came that [[Pyrus]] and [[Nyka]]'s home island of [[Rosula]] had been sacked and utterly destroyed by pirated. Vowing vengeance for her friends, Augusta returned to the archipelago with her newfound fame and knack for [[Divination Magic|divination magic]] to claim undisputed leadership over the family business. Her first act was to seek vengeance for her friends and wipe out the pirates that had murdered their loved ones. In no time, she was receiving requests for aid and protection from all across the archipelago, and her sword ushered in an era of unprecedented peace across the isles which became a beacon of freedom, safety, and trade across the world. Augusta was renowned as the greatest military leader of The Modern Age, with the only potential competition arising in the form of the young Emperor [[Lutekai]] of [[Jespark]].
