[[The Aulva]] were said to have practiced highly advanced magic. Some claim it was taught by [[True Dragons]], others that it was stolen, but [[The Veriglas]] believes it was granted to them by the god [[Hwain]]. Regardless of the origin, The Aulva were believed to be able to shape the very land around them, moving seas and mountains at their whim. This magic was slow and could take centuries, but to the long-lived Aulva this time would pass in the blink of an eye.
