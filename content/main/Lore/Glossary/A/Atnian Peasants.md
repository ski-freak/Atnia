[[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]]'s Bronze Caste made up nearly 90% of its population prior to [[The Apocalypse]]. Though the [[Atnian Nobility|nobility]] enjoyed special privileges allowing them to hold many offices in Atnia unavailable to the peasantry, the peasants held all the same rights under the law. Certain offices were only available to the peasantry ensuring they would always have representation in government, even if this power often amounted to little. The greatest difference between peasants and nobility in Atnia is that peasants required travel papers (generally distributed on an as needed basis by [[The Arbiters|arbiters]] or Nobles) declaring their intent to pass checkpoints on the roads.
