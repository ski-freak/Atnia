An order of [[Law Magic|law mages]] who served as lawyers, judges, and police across [[main/Lore/Glossary/A/Atnia|Atnia]]. The order was largely wiped out in the wake of [[Hwain's Last Stand]]. Some have been taught the old ways by [[Arbiter's Tome|Arbiter's Tomes]], however, many of whom seek to restore the old [[Atnian Law|Laws of Atnia]] and reside within the still standing [[The Stronghold of The Arbiters|Stronghold of The Arbiters]].
