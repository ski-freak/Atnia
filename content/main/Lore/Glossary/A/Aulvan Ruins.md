*"There is a Place Old Powers Roam
Hidden Deep 'Neath Root and Loam"*

Evidence of the great [[The Aulva|Aulvan]] civilization dots the whole landscape of [[The Old World]]. These dungeons have often become the homes of monsters, and their entrances are frequently guarded by [[Ogers|ogers]] with their strange riddles. Many of them seem to descend endlessly into the earth. These ruins are full of old [[Aulvan Language|Aulvan carvings]] and magical treasures. The ruins are particularly frequent in the great stretch of land between [[Atnia]] and [[Mnem (nation)|Mnem]], with the most famous being the ruins at [[Aton]].
