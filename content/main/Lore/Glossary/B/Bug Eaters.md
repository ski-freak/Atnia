Pollinating insects are considered to be "handed" species in most [[Goblins|goblin]] cultures around the world, which is their closest equivalent to the concept of sentience. "Bug Eater" is thus an accusation of some great weight in goblin cultures, implying choosing one's own wishes over other life. Different goblins have different relationships with the concept of eating bugs. In many goblin cultures some bug eating is normal, and the moniker of "Bug Eater" is only granted to those who eat bugs en masse or farm bugs. Others eat no bugs and view all who do as "Bug Eaters". Still, it is mostly agreed upon that to consume entire hives of insects is a terrible thing. 

Bug Eating is also tied to one of the darkest forms of magic for goblins: [[Bug Hunts]].
