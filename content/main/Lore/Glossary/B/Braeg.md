Braeg is the crippled god of the forge. According to [[The Veriglas]] he is [[Hwain]]'s eldest son, and was set to inherit his throne before receiving a permanent magical injury to his left leg at the hands of [[Loravin]] the Deceiver. Though he still bears some resentment towards his half brother and lord of the gods [[Ozen]], he is known as the pinnacle of a professional craftsman who would never place such grudges above his pride in his work. 

In the old world Braeg was a patron of craftsmen and doctors. After [[Hwain's Last Stand]], Braeg is primarily worshiped by [[The Order of the Torch]] in [[main/Lore/Glossary/K/The Knights of Redemption|The Knights of Redemption]] and in [[The Church of The Forge]] in [[main/Lore/Glossary/O/The Old Watch|The Old Watch]]. No known priest has made contact with Braeg since the last stand.
