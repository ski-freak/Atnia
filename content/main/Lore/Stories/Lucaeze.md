Lucaeze awoke to the blissfully rancid scent of manure, carried across the summering fields of the Middle Wall and through the cracks in the dark wood planks of his shack on a cool morning breeze. He filled his lungs. *I might well be the last traditionalist* he thought, savoring the stench. The Old Watch was falling away to nobility and waste, he was sure. He stretched his arms above him and lurched his creaking bones towards the sky, closing his eyes in serene rapture in spite of the strain. He might as well have been climbing to the heavens themselves. 

He slid his legs from his bed and opened his eyes again, scanning the cluttered little hovel for where he had cast his plain working garments. Too long had the younger generations enjoyed the comforts of plenty and the safety of the Outer Wall. They knew nothing of the battles that had to be fought to purify this soil from the twin corruptions of decadence and witchcraft. It was the greatest of ironies, he thought, that the very children for whom they had made this safe haven would be the ones to welcome its decay with open arms. No, to invite it into their very hearts. 

*Perhaps the gods were right to leave us behind.*

The old man closed his eyes once more and mumbled a prayer under his breath. 

*Please spare me the penance for the crimes of my kin. You know that through my trials I have stayed ever loyal. Please, find it in your hearts to spare the faithful from your wrath.*

In a trance he dressed and stepped through his doorway onto the winding lane that led from his house through the fields. His reverie coerced a shocking agility from his youthless frame, as though in casting his mind to the heavens he allowed the gods themselves to possess his physical form. His prayer continued as he traversed the lane, mumbled under his breath with a singleminded attention innocent to the greetings he was receiving from the occasional but increasingly frequent neighbor he passed as he neared the inner gate.
