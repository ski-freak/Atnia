# Prologue

Contrary to how it is oft remembered, the revolution was not a particularly bloody affair. At least, not as far as such things go. Not at first, anyway. On the night of the revolt a dozen died on The Wall for every one who fell to the storming of the palace. Every soldier in The Old Watch was occupied protecting noble and peasant alike from the onslaught of demonic horrors outside. The battle within was carried out between greenseeds unused to killing and dying with spars<sup>1</sup> in their hands. 

*"Murderers!"*

The sharp cry of the elderly Madame Boufon cut across the patter of bootsteps up the thin wooden servant's staircase through which the insurgents were emerging into the palace. She was standing over the near-corpse of her husband, quietly drawing his final ragged breaths as his lungs filled with the same blood that was pooling on the elegantly patterned carpet. His killer, a stableboy no older than sixteen, stood like a pale statue frozen in time. He had not moved a muscle since his impassioned charge had brought his spear into contact with the old man's chest. 

No one else spoke for a time, blood dripping evenly from the boys spear as though counting the seconds it took for the rest of his comrades to emerge from the staircase. Muffled shouts could be heard from above, and the great bell at the top of the palace began to produce a great cacophony that cut through the night drowning out all else. Time was, perhaps, growing short, but it was as though none of the revolutionaries dared interrupt the scene in the center of the room. They rushed into the room one by one and then filed around the edges of the foyer, staring silently at the old woman, the boy, and the dead man. 

Limping on a short cane, a hunchbacked older man was the last to mount the stair. His eyes full of fire, he gazed around the room. "What are you waiting for!?" He bellowed over the clamor of the bell.

At his command, all but one of the ragged mob swept up the next staircase. The boy stood motionless until the old man reached up to place a gentle hand as close to his shoulder as he could reach.

"Miles..."

Miles returned suddenly to motion with a great shudder that passed through his whole body. A moment later he had collapsed onto one of the fine velvet couches, quietly sobbing. The room felt still and quiet, the discordant symphony from the floors above of clanging metal held together by the even rhythm of boots on wood and accented with frantic shouts seemed a world away. The faux silence felt oppressive, like a mounting pressure that could only end in explosion. An eternity passed in seconds.

*"MURDERERS!"*

The woman cried again, this time with an accusatory fire in her eyes almost drowning out the fear. Miles shuddered again. 

"Aye." The old man replied slowly, barely audible over the noise from upstairs. "Murderers of murderers." He spat at her feet.

Boufon grew wide eyed, her defiance tinged with confusion.

"The boy there has such heart as to mourn his brother's killer." He raised his cane to gesture at Miles. "Did the dead man even spare a thought when he whipped a child bloody?" The low rumble of his voice was building to a frenzy as he brought his cane an inch from the woman's throat, "Did *you* when my granddaughter..."

"Nay... There's no point to it." He trailed off, seeing the woman's face clouded with fear, without a trace of comprehension in her eyes. "Miles, tie her hands, we should check on the others."

*"Murderers..."*

The old woman's accusation came out now as a quiet sob. The sounds of combat had already begun to slow by the time the pair reached the stairs. 

When it was clear that the knights were not returning to their defense, the hollow clattering of the palace bell tumbled to a halt, as antimelodic in its decrescendo as it was anticlimactic. The nobles gave their surrender before its final pitiful jangle. For their part, the peasants were still reeling from the horror of the scant killings they had already done, and were more than happy to replace the spars in their hands with ale. 

The celebrations were short lived. 

<sup>1</sup> In Atnian, "spar" as a noun can refer to any bladed weapon. 

# 1: Down With The Old
Lucaeze awoke to the blissfully rancid scent of manure, carried across the summering fields of the Middle Wall and through the cracks in the dark wood planks of his shack on a cool morning breeze. He filled his lungs. *I might well be the last traditionalist* he thought, savoring the stench. The Old Watch was falling away to nobility and waste, he was sure. He stretched his arms above him and lurched his creaking bones towards the sky, closing his eyes in serene rapture in spite of the strain. He might as well have been climbing to the heavens themselves. 

He slid his legs from his bed and opened his eyes again, scanning the cluttered little hovel for where he had cast his plain working garments. Too long had the younger generations enjoyed the comforts of plenty and the safety of the Outer Wall. They knew nothing of the battles that had to be fought to purify this soil from the twin corruptions of decadence and witchcraft. It was the greatest of ironies, he thought, that the very children for whom they had made this safe haven would be the ones to welcome its decay with open arms. No, to invite it into their very hearts. 

*Perhaps the gods were right to leave us behind.*

The old man closed his eyes once more and mumbled a prayer under his breath. 

*Please spare me the penance for the crimes of my kin. You know that through my trials I have stayed ever loyal. Please, find it in your hearts to spare the faithful from your wrath.*

In a trance he dressed and stepped through his doorway onto the winding lane that led from his house through the fields. His reverie coerced a shocking agility from his youthless frame, as though in casting his mind to the heavens he allowed the gods themselves to possess his physical form. His prayer continued as he traversed the lane, mumbled under his breath with a singleminded attention innocent to the greetings he was receiving from the occasional but increasingly frequent neighbor he passed as he neared the inner gate.
