- There is a folder structure on the left. Online it is labeled "Explorer" & only viewable in wide screen.
- Online, search using *Ctrl+k*, in Obsidian, use *Ctrl+Shift+F*. The search function is quite good if you know any of the words you are looking for, it searches both the names and contents of pages.
- The [Navigation](./tags/navigation) tag is used on pages meant to aggregate other pages. Check it out if you are lost on this site.
- Each page/file has backlinks, linking to files that mention the file you are currently on.

Tags are useful for navigation as well:
