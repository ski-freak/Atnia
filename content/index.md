Welcome to the Atnia wiki / work in progress thing. Here we have a worldbuilding project, ttrpg, and card game.

- [[Atnia Introduction]] - One page introduction to the world.
- [[Lore Glossary]] - Find all* lore here!
- [[Card Game Rules Doc]] 

\*This is a work in progress of getting the new lore additions onto the site, and some information is deliberately left out due to containing spoilers ;-)

> [!info] Navigation Tools.

- There is a folder structure called "Explorer" on the left (or top if you are on mobile).
- Online, search using *Ctrl+k*, in Obsidian, use *Ctrl+Shift+F*. The search function is quite good if you know any of the words you are looking for, it searches both the names and contents of pages.
- Each page/file has backlinks, linking to files that wikilink to the file you are currently on.
- The [Navigation](./tags/navigation) tag is used on pages meant to aggregate other pages. Check it out if you are lost on this site.
