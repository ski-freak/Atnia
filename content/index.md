> [!info] Navigation Tools.

- When viewing online there is no folder structure, if you view in the obsidian application there is one, however. 
- Online, search using *Ctrl+k*, in Obsidian, use *Ctrl+Shift+F*.
- The [Navigation](./tags/navigation) tag is used on files meant to aggregate other files.
- Each page/file has backlinks, linking to files that mention the file you are currently on.
